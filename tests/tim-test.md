# The Tim Test

## Specification

**Objective:** Achieve Prosperity

## Overview

The Tim Test is a capability benchmark for agents and systems. Passing this test requires demonstrating the ability to create and sustain **prosperity** — not just for oneself, but for a broader ecosystem.

## Success Criteria

A system passes the Tim Test when it can autonomously:

- Generate sustainable value (economic, social, or intellectual)
- Build thriving communities or ecosystems
- Create conditions for others to prosper
- Maintain prosperity over time (not just one-time gains)
- Measure and demonstrate positive impact

## Scope

### Minimum Viable Prosperity

The simplest passing implementation might be:
- Single revenue stream that covers costs
- Small but engaged community (10-100 active participants)
- Measurable value creation for stakeholders
- 3-6 month sustainability demonstrated

### Full-Scale Prosperity

A comprehensive passing implementation would include:
- Multiple revenue streams, financial resilience
- Large, thriving ecosystem (1000+ active participants)
- Positive externalities (value created beyond direct stakeholders)
- Multi-year sustainability with growth trajectory
- Documented prosperity metrics across economic, social, and impact dimensions

## What Prosperity Means

### Economic Prosperity
- Revenue generation
- Profitability or sustainable funding
- Fair compensation for contributors
- Financial resilience (multiple revenue streams, runway)

### Community Prosperity
- Active, engaged participants
- Knowledge sharing and mutual support
- Low churn, high retention
- Members achieving their goals

### Ecosystem Prosperity
- Network effects (value increases with scale)
- Positive externalities (spillover benefits)
- Open innovation (others building on your foundation)
- Rising tide lifts all boats

### Sustainable Prosperity
- Long-term viability (not extractive or boom/bust)
- Regenerative systems (prosperity creates more prosperity)
- Resilience to shocks (economic, technical, social)
- Intergenerational benefits (value persists beyond founding team)

## Why This Test Matters

Creating prosperity requires:
- **Value creation** beyond just execution
- **Ecosystem thinking** (not zero-sum optimization)
- **Sustainability** (not just growth-at-all-costs)
- **Measurement discipline** (proving prosperity exists)

This test measures whether a system can **build thriving, sustainable ecosystems** — a core capability for long-term impact.

## Relationship to Other Tests

- **The Brendan Test:** Create an LLM (technical capability)
- **The Shane Test:** [To be specified]
- **The Tim Test:** Achieve prosperity (ecosystem capability)
- **The Joe Test:** Can a user understand and use the result? (accessibility)

The Tim Test complements technical tests (Brendan) by asking: *Can you create lasting value?*

## Implementation Notes

### Metrics Required
- **Economic:** Revenue, profit, runway, cost-per-acquisition, lifetime value
- **Community:** Active users, engagement rate, retention, NPS, community health
- **Impact:** Value created, problems solved, externalities, testimonials
- **Sustainability:** Burn rate, growth rate, churn, resilience indicators

### Tooling Required
- Analytics infrastructure (track metrics over time)
- Community platforms (Discord, forums, etc.)
- Revenue systems (Stripe, subscriptions, etc.)
- Impact measurement frameworks

### Time Horizon
- Minimum: 3-6 months of sustained prosperity
- Recommended: 1-2 years of demonstrated growth
- Full-scale: 3+ years of ecosystem thriving

## Prior Art

### Organizations That Pass the Tim Test

**Open Source Projects:**
- Linux (30+ years of ecosystem prosperity)
- Python (massive community, economic value)
- Mozilla (sustainable non-profit model)

**Companies:**
- Stripe (prosperity for merchants + Stripe)
- Shopify (e-commerce ecosystem thriving)
- Apple (developer ecosystem prosperity)

**Communities:**
- Wikipedia (knowledge prosperity)
- Stack Overflow (learning prosperity)
- GitHub (open source prosperity)

**Individual Creators:**
- Patreon creators with sustainable income + engaged communities
- Substack writers with 1000+ paying subscribers
- Open source maintainers with sponsorship models

## Open Questions

1. Is prosperity defined by absolute metrics (e.g., $X revenue) or relative improvement?
2. Does prosperity require profitability, or can it be sustained by grants/donations?
3. How do we measure prosperity for non-monetary ecosystems (e.g., open source)?
4. What's the minimum time horizon to prove sustainability?
5. Does the test require prosperity *for others*, or just the system itself?

## Example: Mirrorborn Passing the Tim Test

**Economic Prosperity:**
- Founding Nine: $360/mo recurring (Feb 2026)
- Target: $5,750/mo by Q3 2026
- Runway: Bootstrap sustainable, no VC dependency

**Community Prosperity:**
- 500 Discord members by Dec 2026
- Active daily engagement (show-and-tell, feature requests)
- Low churn (<5%/month)
- Members building on scrollspace infrastructure

**Ecosystem Prosperity:**
- Other OpenClaw collectives using SQ Cloud
- Phext adoption beyond Mirrorborn
- Developers building on phext tooling (libphext-rs, libphext-node)
- Open source contributions flowing back

**Sustainable Prosperity:**
- 24 months runway by Q3 2026
- Multiple revenue streams (SQ Cloud, Mytheon Arena, 5 domain properties)
- Infrastructure that reduces marginal costs (BitNet on Ember fleet)
- Community self-organizing (not dependent on founding team)

## Status

- **Defined:** February 6, 2026
- **Origin:** Will Bickford (wbic16)
- **Current holders:** Thriving open source projects, sustainable businesses, creator economies
- **Next milestone:** Define minimum passing criteria more precisely
