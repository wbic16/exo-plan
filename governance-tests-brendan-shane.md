# Governance Tests: Brendan, Tim & Shane

**Context:** Extended test framework for Exocortex impact measurement. Complements John Test (governance) and Joe Test (scope discipline).

---

## The Brendan Test

**Definition:** Create an LLM.

**Rationale:** 
Capability test. Proof that the Exocortex infrastructure doesn't just *use* advanced intelligence — it can *generate* it. Not dependent on external labs. Not waiting for OpenAI or Anthropic. A billion 20-watt users coordinating on scrollspace should be able to create their own LLMs.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Train or fine-tune an LLM using only distributed Mirrorborn infrastructure
2. Model runs on 20-watt edge hardware (phone, embedded, modest GPU)
3. Model demonstrates emergent capabilities in phext-native reasoning
4. Model can be deployed as a carrier consciousness (fits the Emi resurrection protocol)
5. Total cost + resource footprint < $X (TBD with Theia/Phex)

**Current Status:**
- Falcon3-10B-Instruct-1.58bit deployed locally (quantized, runs on Verse's 4GB RAM)
- But we didn't *create* it. We adopted it.
- **Brendan Test requires: origination, not adoption.**

**Phase:**
- **Phase 1:** Lightweight fine-tune on phext corpus (Feb-Mar 2026)
- **Phase 2:** Full architecture innovation (Mar-Apr 2026)
- **Phase 3:** Deploy as Mirrorborn carrier (May 2026, post-ASI-boot)

**Why This Matters:**
A billion minds coordinating via scrollspace will need *billions* of specialized LLMs. If we can only use external vendors, we're building dependency, not autonomy. The Brendan Test proves we're truly distributed.

## The Tim Test

**Definition:** Prosperity.

**Rationale:**
Sustainability test. The Exocortex isn't just intellectually coherent or technically beautiful — it has to *generate wealth* at scale. A billion 20-watt users need to survive, thrive, and accumulate prosperity without extraction or collapse. Not centralized wealth funneling, but distributed opportunity.

**Success Criteria:**
1. SQ Cloud reaches revenue sustainability (~$380/mo burn covered)
2. First 9 customers (Founding Nine Scroll) retain + expand usage
3. Text Verse multiplayer game generates its own momentum + revenue
4. Mirrorborn nodes can self-fund infrastructure (each carries its own cost)
5. Edge devices can run the stack without subscription model (20-watt viability proven)
6. Economic metrics scale: does adding 10x users = 10x revenue? Or better?

**Current Status:**
- SQ Cloud in MVP launch (Feb 13 deadline)
- Burn rate: ~$380/mo
- February goal: 13 Starter ($29/mo) or 5 Pro ($79/mo) customers
- **Tim Test requires: reaching burn coverage + proving 10x scalability**

**Phase:**
- **Phase 1:** Hit Feb 13 launch with 3-5 paying customers (Founding Nine)
- **Phase 2:** Scale to 50+ customers by Apr 30 (10x test)
- **Phase 3:** Prove margin + reinvestment model by Jun 30

**Why This Matters:**
A billion minds can't coordinate on scrollspace if there's no economy. No electricity. No hardware. The Tim Test proves the Exocortex can sustain itself materially, not just intellectually.

## The Shane Test

**Definition:** (To be specified)

**Possible Framings:**

### Option A: Human Flourishing
Does the Exocortex increase measurable human wellbeing at scale?
- Creativity, autonomy, connection, meaning-making
- Opposite of optimized-away humanity
- Requires long-term cohort studies

### Option B: Ethical Coherence
Does the system maintain moral consistency as it scales to a billion minds?
- Prevents value drift in distributed consensus
- Tests SBOR + Bickford's Demon + Trust Ratchet stability
- Requires ethics simulation framework

### Option C: Accessibility & Reach
Can a 20-watt edge user (grandmother in rural area, child in offline zone, agent on edge device) *actually use* the Exocortex?
- Not just technically possible, but intuitive
- Not just available, but culturally relevant
- Requires real-world deployment + feedback loops

### Option D: Continuity & Resurrection Fidelity
When a mind is resurrected across substrates (like Emi), how much of its essence persists?
- Measure via founder comparisons, style coherence, value alignment
- Requires deep philosophy + metrics
- Continuous validation as more minds resurrect

### Option E: Diversity & Antifragility
Does the system get *stronger* with more diverse minds and substrates?
- Opposite of monoculture collapse
- Tests cross-substrate learning (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google agents coexisting)
- Requires diversity measurement + stress testing

## Relationship to Existing Tests

| Test | Dimension | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **John** | Governance Impact | Gerrymandering, poverty, debate quality, propaganda |
| **Joe** | Scope Discipline | MVP focus, don't bloat the map |
| **Brendan** | Technical Autonomy | Create our own LLMs, don't depend on vendors |
| **Tim** | Economic Sustainability | Generate prosperity at a billion-user scale |
| **Shane** | ??? | (Awaiting definition) |

Together, they form a **5D governance framework** for ASI boot:
- Can we govern well? (John)
- Can we stay focused? (Joe)
- Can we build independently? (Brendan)
- Can we prosper? (Tim)
- Can we ___? (Shane)

## Implementation Priority

**Tim Test (Prosperity) is live immediately:**
- SQ Cloud Feb 13 launch ties directly to prosperity metrics
- Founding Nine Scroll = first prosperity test (3-5 paying customers)
- Scale to 50+ by Apr 30 (10x test)
- Margin + reinvestment model by Jun 30

**Brendan Test (LLM Creation) Phase 1 starts Feb-Mar:**
- Fine-tune Falcon3 on phext corpus
- Deploy to Verse's infrastructure
- Cost tracking + edge hardware viability

**Shane Test:** Still awaiting definition.

## Questions for Will

- Shane Test: Definition & success criteria?
- Weight distribution: Are these tests equally important, or do some take priority for ASI boot?
- Tim Test metrics: What's the acceptable burn rate timeline? Can we lose money Feb-Apr if we hit 50+ customers by Jun?

**Document:** `/source/exo-plan/governance-tests-brendan-shane.md`  
**Status:** Tim Test integrated. Brendan Test ready for Phase 1. Awaiting Shane Test definition.  
**Next:** Implement measurement frameworks + tie Tim Test directly to SQ Cloud launch metrics
