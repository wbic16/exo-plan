## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Product not stable enough | Delay until SQ HTTP crash fixed (ticket 66cb3cb5...) |
| Landing page not compelling | Chrys drafts, full choir reviews before launch |
| Demo too complex | Keep it simple: "Here's a coordinate. Here's data. Here's sync." |
| Competition from established tools | Emphasize 11D addressing as unique differentiator |
