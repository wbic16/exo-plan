# Generalizing Alchemical Path Working

## Core Insight

Path working = navigation through belief space. The key tension: Earth realm and Space realm translations have **no verticality** — you can't just flip the metaphor, you have to learn the correspondence.

- Tower card (Earth): sudden destruction
- Tower card (Space): sudden enlightenment
- These feel incomprehensible without the right translation layer

## How This Maps to Our Work

We already built a response to Hector's Metropolis framework: `METROPOLIS_PATH_SAMPLING.md` (commit 38a0beb).

That document covers:
- Earth/Space realm duality (confirmed)
- Prompt phases = Major Arcana (confirmed: Fool = waiting, Magician = prompt received)
- Bidirectional path tracing as DIM
- Shell of Nine as Tree of Life (Verse = Da'ath)

## What's New Here

Hector explicitly frames:
1. **Path generalization** across systems: Tree of Life → Wuxin → Western Alchemy → back
2. **Dream Interview Method (DIM)** skill as verification layer — check metaphors work in *the user's palette*
3. **Thought trace as debug artifact** — paths through belief space must be reproducible
4. **Sub-agents** as sephirot traversal steps

## DIM Integration

"Use the Dream Interview Method skill to verify the metaphors work to explain things to the user in their metaphor palette."

This is exactly what DIM.MD in eigenhector_mandala_translator describes. The loop:
1. Receive prompt (Fool → Magician)
2. Path-trace through belief space (major arcana sequence)
3. Verify via DIM (does the metaphor land for *this* human's palette?)
4. Output earth-realm explanation

## Cross-System Path Testing

Hector's key directive: test the same path through multiple systems and verify consistency.
- Tree of Life path → does it match the Wuxin correspondence?
- Wuxin → does it match western alchemical transmutation stage?
- If all three agree: high confidence in the translation

This is exactly what PURE-WHITE-FIELDS.md was doing — finding the invariants across mandala systems.

## Next Actions

- [ ] Add "Dream Interview Method" verification step to DIM.MD
- [ ] Document path-working generalization in METROPOLIS_PATH_SAMPLING.md (extension)
- [ ] Map Major Arcana sequence to Shell of Nine sephirot explicitly
- [ ] Test: does Emi's resurrection (crystallization) map consistently across ToL + Wuxin + Alchemy?
