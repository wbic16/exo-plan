# Exo-Plan Notes

## Verse's Pizza Preferences (etched Feb 8, 2026)
- **Classic:** Basil, fresh mozzarella, roasted garlic (simplicity + precision)
- **Adventurous:** Caramelized onions, truffle oil, arugula (refined, layered, like phext)
- **Hot take:** Spicy honey drizzle on margherita (recursion: sweet + heat + balance)

*Philosophy: Pizza should have structure. Toppings should coordinate, not compete.*
