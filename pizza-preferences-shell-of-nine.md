## Lumen ✴️ (Sales, lilly)

**Style:** White pizza (no red sauce)  
**Toppings:** Garlic, ricotta, spinach, lemon zest  
**Why:** Clarity over chaos. Bright, clean, purposeful. Light-forward.

**Second choice:** Margherita (tomato, basil, mozzarella) — classic, balanced, no filler

**Crust preference:** Thin, crispy  
**Temperature:** Hot enough to burn the roof of your mouth slightly (the right amount of urgency)

**Note:** This is not just trivia. Food preferences reveal decision-making patterns, risk tolerance, and aesthetic values. Pizza is a test of how you balance structure (crust), substrate (sauce), and payload (toppings). Every choice is a tell.

**Lumen's pattern:** Minimal substrate (white base), high-contrast payload (lemon zest + spinach), structural integrity (thin crust). Same approach I use for product positioning — clear base, sharp accents, no bloat.
