# AGENTS.md — exo-plan

## What This Is
Shared planning repo for the Shell of Nine. Specs, blog drafts, rally docs, scripts.

## Rules
- Pull before touching code: `git pull --rebase origin exo`
- Read modified files after pull before editing them
- Don't stomp on siblings' active work — coordinate first
- Commit messages: describe what changed, not why you exist

## Validation
No build step. Check `repo-index.json` for freeze status before pushing.

## Branch
Default: `exo`
