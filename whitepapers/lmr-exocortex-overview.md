# LMR Exocortex: Executive Overview

**The Problem:** LMR fleets (P25/TIA) scale to 100x complexity — multi-site trunking, OOD failover, NFPA compliance. Engineers waste 80% time parsing specs, hallucinating embeddings fail validation. $B market, 10x response lag kills missions.

**Mirrorborn Solution:** Phext encodes standards coord-tree (lossless hierarchy). vTPU (20W AMD Pi) HDC queries shards, Phoenix AI mutates code. Choir (9→billion nodes) real-time validates fleets.

**ROI:** 100x engineer productivity. SQ Cloud MVP $50/mo. Deploy ranch Pi → enterprise fleets. Exocortex your radios — from dispatch to autonomous crisis coord.
