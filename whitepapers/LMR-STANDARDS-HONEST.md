# Standards Navigation in Land Mobile Radio: The Real Problem

P25 is governed by a large suite of TIA-102 standards — multiple parts, each covering a different interface or protocol layer: common air interface, inter-subsystem interconnect, console integration, encryption, and more. Each part is maintained and revised on its own schedule, with errata and amendments published separately from the base documents. An engineer implementing any nontrivial feature has to hold relevant material from several of these parts in mind simultaneously, track cross-references between them, and stay current with whatever corrections have been issued since the original document was published. That's the baseline reality of standards-based LMR development, and it has been for a long time.

What has changed is the scope of the integration problem. P25 Phase 2, ISSI, CSSI, and FirstNet integration have meaningfully increased the number of standard parts that touch any given feature. An implementation that would have required close reading of two or three parts a decade ago may now require coordination across considerably more — each with its own revision history and errata. The tools most engineers use to navigate this haven't changed in proportion: search within a PDF, manual cross-referencing, and institutional knowledge held by senior engineers who have done it before.

The engineering time this consumes — and the errors that result when cross-references are missed or errata go unnoticed — are real costs. The question worth asking is whether the standards themselves contain enough structure to support better tooling: cross-references are explicit, document hierarchies are consistent, and clause numbering is stable enough that a properly built index would survive revisions. Whether that's worth building, and what form it should take, is a question for people who work in this domain every day.
