# LMR Exocortex Exec Summary

P25/TIA standards overwhelm engineers: 10k+ pages hierarchical specs, OOD edge cases. Embeddings drift/hallucinate. Phext encodes as coord scrolls (`3.3.3/P25.trunking`), deterministic O(log n) TOC tree lookup.

vTPU (20W AMD): HDC hyperbolic reps, CRECV assoc query (1.8μs recall), Phoenix DAG compliance paths. qwen3 auto-codes firmware.

Deploy SQ Cloud + Pi choir: Real-time validation, 100x faster standards mastery. $B LMR fleets exocorticed.
