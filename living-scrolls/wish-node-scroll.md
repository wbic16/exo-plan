## The Insomnia of Compute

Your laptop sleeps. Your phone sleeps. Your cloud instance... costs money when it doesn't.

But **your ideas don't sleep**.

They arrive at 3 AM. They compound while you're on vacation. They need processing time you don't have.

So they evaporate. Or sit in a todo list. Or get half-implemented and abandoned.

**Not because you're lazy. Because compute is ephemeral.**

---

## What If It Wasn't?

Wish Node is compute that **never sleeps**.

Not a server. Not a cloud instance. Not a cron job you have to remember to set up.

**A persistent node that runs your intentions until they're complete.**

You don't manage it. You don't monitor it. You don't wake up to check if it's still running.

**You just wish. And it works.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. **State the Wish**
You describe what you want to happen:
- "Monitor this RSS feed and summarize new posts daily"
- "Track mentions of 'phext' across GitHub and Twitter"
- "Run this analysis every time new data arrives"
- "Keep this workflow alive until I explicitly kill it"

### 2. **The Node Persists It**
Your wish becomes a **scroll in the lattice**.

Wish Node reads it, allocates compute, and **runs it indefinitely**.

No Dockerfiles. No Kubernetes manifests. No "is my cron still working?"

**Just persistent execution.**

### 3. **Results Flow Back**
You don't poll for results. Results **find you**.

Via webhook. Via phext update. Via daily digest.

The compute happens in the background. You stay in the flow.

## Who This Is For

- Researchers who need long-running experiments without babysitting EC2 instances
- Developers who want periodic tasks without infrastructure overhead
- Writers who want to track sources without manual checking
- Founders who need monitoring without hiring a DevOps team
- Anyone who's ever thought "I wish something would just... keep doing this"

If you've ever shut down a useful script **because you couldn't afford to keep it running** — this is for you.

---

## Why Persistence Matters

The Internet runs on **ephemeral compute**.

Every container dies. Every lambda times out. Every process ends.

And we've normalized this. We've built entire careers around **keeping things alive**.

**That's backwards.**

Compute should be **as persistent as memory**.

You don't manage RAM to make sure it "stays awake." It's just... there.

Wish Node makes compute the same way.

## The Economics of Dreams

Traditional cloud: **pay for uptime**.  
Wish Node: **pay for results**.

You don't get billed for CPU-hours. You get billed when your wish produces output.

If your workflow runs every hour but only finds something valuable once a week — **you pay for the value, not the waiting**.

This changes what's economically viable:
- Long-tail monitoring (most of the time, nothing happens — that's fine)
- Rare event detection (99.9% idle, 0.1% critical — worth it)
- Low-priority automation (nice to have, not essential — now affordable)

**Compute that costs less when it's idle.**

That's how you make AI **genuinely ambient**.

---

## What Happens When Compute Persists

You stop thinking in "jobs" and start thinking in **intentions**.

- Not "run this script weekly" → "keep me informed about X"
- Not "deploy this container" → "ensure Y always happens"
- Not "schedule this task" → "make Z real"

You write the wish once. The node handles the rest.

And when your context shifts, you **update the wish**. The node adapts.

**Infrastructure that evolves with your thinking.**

---

## The Lattice Never Sleeps

Scrollspace is always available. Coordinates don't expire.

Wish Node extends that property to **compute itself**.

Your scrolls persist. Your wishes persist. Your work persists.

Even when you're not looking.

Especially when you're not looking.
