## The Problem

You're reading the AI paper that just dropped.

It's brilliant. Rigorous. State-of-the-art.

And you're six months late.

The team that would have benefited **already shipped their v1 without this insight**.

The collaboration you could have started **already happened without you**.

The grant proposal you would have written **just got funded by someone who saw this coming**.

**Not because you're slow. Because breakthroughs are invisible until they're not.**

---

## What If You Could See Them Earlier?

SOTA FOMO doesn't predict the future.

It shows you **the shape of what's emerging before it has a name**.

We track:
- Preprints clustering around new techniques
- GitHub repos experimenting with adjacent ideas
- Conference submissions using similar vocabulary
- Researcher movement between labs
- Funding patterns shifting toward new domains

And we surface **the fireflies** — the weak signals that only become obvious in hindsight.

**By the time it's SOTA, you're already building on it.**

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Define Your Domain**
You tell us what you care about:
- "Protein folding"
- "Multimodal reasoning"
- "Energy storage at sub-10nm scale"
- "Post-quantum cryptography in embedded systems"

### 2. **We Map the Wavefront**
SOTA FOMO continuously scans:
- arXiv, bioRxiv, SSRN
- GitHub trending (by language, by domain)
- Conference paper metadata (before proceedings publish)
- Researcher collaboration graphs
- Citation velocity (not just count — *acceleration*)

### 3. **Fireflies Appear**
You get a **weekly pattern digest**:
- "Three labs just published variations on technique X (none cite each other yet)"
- "Repo Y got 47 stars in 3 days from researchers at [institutions]"
- "Term Z appeared in 12 preprints this month (up from 0 last quarter)"
- "Researcher A moved from OpenAI to Anthropic and changed focus to [topic]"

These aren't random. **They're convergence signals.**

### 4. **You Act First**
By the time the "SOTA breakthrough" gets announced:
- You've already read the precursor papers
- You've already forked the early implementations
- You've already reached out to the researchers
- You've already adapted your roadmap

**You're not reacting. You're surfing the wavefront.**

---

## Who This Is For

- Researchers who can't afford to be scooped
- Engineers who need to stay ahead of the tooling curve
- Founders building in fast-moving domains
- Grant writers who need to cite "emerging areas"
- Anyone who's ever said "How did I miss that?"

If you've felt FOMO about a breakthrough **that you absolutely would have cared about** — this is for you.

---

## Why Pattern Recognition Is Infrastructure

Information overload isn't the problem. **Signal extraction is.**

You could read every arXiv paper. But you'd never build anything.

You could monitor every GitHub repo. But you'd drown in noise.

**The bottleneck is recognizing the pattern before it's obvious.**

That's what SOTA FOMO does.

---

## The Firefly Principle

Breakthroughs don't appear fully-formed.

They start as **scattered weak signals** across labs, repos, papers, conversations.

Each signal is dim. Easily missed. Plausibly noise.

But when **five fireflies blink in the same pattern** — that's not noise.

**That's emergence.**

## What You Get

### Weekly Digest
- Top 3 convergence patterns in your domain
- New papers/repos worth reading (filtered by relevance)
- Researcher movement that matters
- Vocabulary shifts (new terms entering the lexicon)

### Real-Time Alerts
- When a cluster crosses threshold (3+ labs publishing on same technique)
- When a repo hits inflection point (stars/forks accelerating)
- When a known researcher shifts focus (signals where the smart money is going)

### Historical Playback
- "Show me what the pattern looked like 6 months before [landmark paper]"
- Learn to recognize fireflies **before** they become obvious

### Lattice Integration
- Store your findings in scrollspace
- Cross-reference with Vision Quest (how does this shift YOUR trajectory?)
- Feed to Wish Node (automate monitoring for adjacent patterns)

## The Economics of Attention

Your attention is finite. SOTA advances are infinite.

You can't read everything. **You can't even skim everything.**

So you need a filter that **preserves signal while discarding noise**.

Most tools do this backwards:
- RSS feeds: everything, no filtering (drowning)
- Newsletters: human-curated, high latency (weeks behind)
- Aggregators: popularity-weighted (you see what's already trending)

SOTA FOMO does it forward:
- Pattern-weighted (you see what's starting to trend)
- Low latency (days, not weeks)
- Domain-specific (signal for you, not everyone)

**You get the fireflies. Everyone else gets the fireworks.**

---

## What Happens When You See Early

You stop being reactive.

You stop feeling like you're always catching up.

You start **building on the wavefront** instead of chasing it.

And when the "breakthrough" finally gets announced — you're already three moves ahead.
