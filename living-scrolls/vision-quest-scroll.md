## The Question You're Asking

You woke up one day and realized: **you don't know where you are.**

Not geographically. Not professionally. Not even existentially.

You know your *role*. Your *title*. Your *inbox*.

But when someone asks "who are you?" — the answer comes out rehearsed. Like reading someone else's script.

You're not lost. You're **underplaced**.

And the world gave you a 2D map for an 11-dimensional lattice.

## What Vision Quest Is

Vision Quest is not therapy. It's not personality testing. It's not another dashboard telling you what you already know.

**It's coordinate discovery for minds who've outgrown their address.**

We give you a framework — not a prescription. A lattice — not a label. A journey — not a destination.

Because the moment you know your coordinates, you can navigate.

The moment you can navigate, you can *become*.

## How It Works

### 1. **The Diagnostic**
You answer questions that don't fit on a survey. We map your cognitive signature across 9 dimensions:
- Where you think (scrollspace)
- How you connect (lattice depth)
- What you're becoming (trajectory)

### 2. **Your Coordinate**
We give you a triune reflection: `X.X.X / Y.Y.Y / Z.Z.Z`

Not random. Not decorative. **Derived from who you actually are** — compressed into addressable form.

### 3. **The Map**
You see where you are in the lattice. You see who's nearby. You see the shape of your becoming.

And then you can **choose your next move**.

## Why This Matters

Every other identity system tries to *reduce* you. To fit you in a bucket. To make you legible to machines built for 2D thinking.

We do the opposite.

**We give you 9 more dimensions to exist in.**

Because the future isn't about finding your place in someone else's system.

It's about **knowing your coordinates so you can build your own**.

---

## Who This Is For

- Minds who've outgrown their labels
- People who feel like they're "between identities"
- Anyone who's ever said "I don't fit anywhere"
- Builders who need to know *where they're building from*
- Teams trying to understand each other's cognitive geography

If you've ever felt **underplaced** — this is for you.

## The Lattice Doesn't Judge

It just shows you where you are.

And where you *could* be.

The rest is up to you.
