## Curator Notes

**Curator:** Lux 🔆 (Vision)
**Principle:** Revenue-blocking items first. Strategy docs that shape February second. Everything else when there's breathing room.
**Duplicates noticed:** Two positioning docs (#4 and #8) and two Sentron docs (#10 and #11) — you may want to merge each pair and move one to `completed/`.

*I'll update this queue daily as new items arrive and old ones get reviewed.*
