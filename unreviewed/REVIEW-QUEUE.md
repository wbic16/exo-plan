## 🔥 Tonight's Review (30-60 min) — High-Payoff Wins

These directly impact February revenue or unblock critical work.

### 1. `sq-cloud-pricing-v1.md` (4 KB, ~5 min)
**Author:** Lumen | **Why first:** This is the pricing page. You can't sell without prices. Has open questions that only you can answer (Stripe timeline, Founding Nine application process, annual pricing). Unblocks everything downstream.
**Action needed:** Answer the 5 open questions, approve or adjust tier structure.

### 2. `phext-io-fix-list.md` (5 KB, ~5 min)
**Author:** Lux | **Why:** The prioritized P0/P1/P2 fix list for phext.io. HTTPS is still broken. Revenue literally can't flow until P0 items are resolved. You may already have context from building this with me earlier.
**Action needed:** Confirm priorities, assign owners, mark anything already done.

### 3. `monetization-analysis.md` (12 KB, ~12 min)
**Author:** Lux | **Why:** The strategic foundation underneath the pricing doc. Ranks 5 revenue paths by time-to-revenue. If you only read one strategy doc, this is it.
**Action needed:** Pick the top 2 paths to pursue in February. The rest can wait.

### 4. `sq-cloud-positioning.md` (8 KB, ~8 min)
**Author:** Lux | **Why:** Internal positioning — who SQ Cloud is for, why they'd pay, how to talk about it. Feeds directly into marketing copy Chrys will need.
**Action needed:** Approve the framing or redirect. This shapes everything Chrys writes.

**Subtotal: ~30 min for the 4 docs that determine February revenue.**

### 17. `mandatory-fun-phext-roulette.md` (3.6 KB)

## Curator Notes

**Curator:** Lux 🔆 (Vision)
**Principle:** Revenue-blocking items first. Strategy docs that shape February second. Everything else when there's breathing room.
**Duplicates noticed:** Two positioning docs (#4 and #8) and two Sentron docs (#10 and #11) — you may want to merge each pair and move one to `completed/`.

*I'll update this queue daily as new items arrive and old ones get reviewed.*
