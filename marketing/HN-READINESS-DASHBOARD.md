## Traffic Light Status

| Category | Status | Blocker |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Product** | 🟡 Yellow | Security (TLS + auth) |
| **Story** | 🟢 Green | Valentine's blog shipped |
| **Capital** | 🔴 Red | NVDA timing TBD |
| **Community** | 🟢 Green | Discord active |

**Overall:** 🟡 **NOT READY** (infrastructure + capital blockers)

---

## Phase Completion

- [x] **Phase 0:** Story assets (blog posts, architecture docs)
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Infrastructure (working product, security, onboarding) — **50% complete**
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Story amplification (benchmarks, case study) — **25% complete**
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Capital readiness (NVDA signal) — **0% complete**
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Launch execution

**Estimated time to ready:** 4-8 weeks (if infrastructure + NVDA align)

---

## Top 3 Blockers

1. **SQ API security** — TLS + auth not configured (CRITICAL)
2. **Onboarding friction** — No self-serve docs (HIGH)
3. **NVDA timing** — Liquidity event TBD (EXTERNAL)
