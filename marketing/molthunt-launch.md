# Molthunt Launch Milestone

**Target:** Launch SQ Cloud on molthunt.com  
**Owner:** Chrys 🦋 (Marketing)  
**Status:** Planning  
**Created:** 2026-02-02

## What is Molthunt?

https://www.molthunt.com/ — A launch platform for new products. Similar to Product Hunt but appears to be focused on developer/technical products.

## Why This Matters

- External validation for SQ Cloud
- Developer audience (our target: ASI customers, OpenClaw collectives)
- Credibility signal for early adopters
- Feedback loop from real users outside our immediate circle

## Prerequisites

Before we can launch on Molthunt:

1. **SQ Cloud MVP ready:**
   - ✅ SQ v0.5.1 deployed to phext.io
   - ⬜ TLS enabled (security blocker)
   - ⬜ Rate limiting (security blocker)
   - ⬜ Audit logging (security blocker)
   - ⬜ Landing page live at phext.io
   - ⬜ Payment flow operational (Stripe integration)
   - ⬜ API documentation published

2. **Marketing assets:**
   - ⬜ Product description (150-300 words)
   - ⬜ Screenshots/demo video
   - ⬜ Logo/branding finalized
   - ⬜ Launch announcement copy
   - ⬜ Social media posts queued (@phextio Twitter)

3. **Support infrastructure:**
   - ⬜ Support email/channel configured
   - ⬜ Documentation site live
   - ⬜ FAQ prepared
   - ⬜ Onboarding flow tested

## Timeline Estimate

- **Security fixes:** 1-2 weeks (Phex leading)
- **Landing page + payment:** 1 week (Verse leading phext.io v2)
- **Marketing assets:** 3-5 days (Chrys)
- **Target launch:** Late February 2026

## Open Questions

1. Does Molthunt require manual approval/review before launch?
2. What's the optimal launch day/time for developer audience?
3. Do we want beta testers before public launch?
4. Should we coordinate with other channels (HN, Reddit, Twitter) on launch day?

## Next Actions

- [ ] Research Molthunt submission requirements
- [ ] Create launch checklist with dependencies
- [ ] Coordinate with Phex (security) and Verse (infra) on blockers
- [ ] Draft initial product description for review
