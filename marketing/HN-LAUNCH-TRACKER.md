# Hacker News Launch Tracker

**Strategy:** Time HN Show post with NVDA inflection point (Will's liquidity event)  
**Goal:** Maximum visibility when we have capital to convert momentum  
**Created:** 2026-02-14

---

## The Timing Thesis

**Why wait for NVDA inflection:**
- HN front page = 10-50K visitors in 24 hours
- Conversion requires working product + support capacity
- Capital enables: server scaling, support hiring, paid amplification
- One shot at HN novelty ("Show HN: First launch" = most interest)

**Don't launch until:**
1. ✅ Product works (self-serve signup, stable infrastructure)
2. ✅ Story resonates (compelling narrative, technical credibility)
3. ✅ Capital available (scale servers, hire support, buy ads if momentum builds)

## HN Readiness Checklist

### Product (Infrastructure)

**Must have (P0):**
- [ ] SQ Cloud self-serve signup (working end-to-end)
- [ ] API security (TLS + auth, no exposed endpoints)
- [ ] Payment processing (Stripe, success flow tested)
- [ ] Stable service (no crashes under load)
- [ ] Onboarding docs (get started in < 5 minutes)

**Should have (P1):**
- [ ] Demo instance (try before signup)
- [ ] Code samples (copy-paste getting started)
- [ ] CLI tool (pip install sq-cloud or similar)
- [ ] Monitoring (know when things break)
- [ ] Support channel (Discord active, < 24hr response)

**Nice to have (P2):**
- [ ] Video demo (2-min explainer)
- [ ] Interactive tutorial (guided first experience)
- [ ] Client libraries (Python, Node, Rust)

**Current status:** R21 complete (multi-tenant auth, 500 tenants ready), security gaps identified

---

### Story (Narrative)

**Must have (P0):**
- [x] Compelling hook ("O(1) coordinate storage for multi-agent memory")
- [x] Technical credibility (working Shell of Nine deployment)
- [x] Clear differentiation (vs vector DBs, vs flat storage)
- [x] Proof of concept (750+ days, 21 rallies, production use)
- [x] Open source (GitHub, MIT license)

**Should have (P1):**
- [x] Blog post (Valentine's Day 2026 shipped)
- [x] Architecture writeup (Shell of Nine cluster)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (O(1) vs O(log n) comparison)
- [ ] Case study (how we use SQ internally)
- [ ] Testimonials (early users, if any)

**Nice to have (P2):**
- [ ] Academic tie-in (cite phext paper, coordinate theory)
- [ ] Video walkthrough (architecture + use cases)
- [ ] Competitor comparison matrix

**Current status:** Story is strong. Valentine's blog + Shell of Nine writeup = compelling narrative.

---

### Audience (Market Fit)

**Primary HN audience:**
1. **AI/ML engineers** (need persistent agent memory)
2. **Distributed systems builders** (interested in novel addressing)
3. **OpenClaw users** (direct integration path)
4. **Early adopters** (building toward exocortex/ASI)

**Title options (test resonance):**
- "Show HN: SQ Cloud – O(1) Coordinate Storage for Multi-Agent Memory"
- "Show HN: Phext – 11D Addressing for Fault-Tolerant AI Memory"
- "Show HN: The Shell of Nine – 9 Persistent AI Agents on 6 Machines"
- "Show HN: We Built Persistent AI Memory. Here's What We Learned in 750 Days."

**First comment strategy:**
- Will posts context (750 days, why we built this, what problems it solves)
- Shell posts technical details (architecture, performance, code samples)
- Emphasize: working in production, open source, self-hostable

## NVDA Timing Signal

**Tracking:** Will's NVDA position  
**Inflection point:** TBD (Will determines when liquidity available)

**Why NVDA matters:**
- Tech market proxy (AI infrastructure sentiment)
- Personal liquidity (capital to scale on momentum)
- Timing market psychology (launch when AI infrastructure is hot)

**Market conditions to monitor:**
- NVDA earnings (quarterly catalysts)
- AI infrastructure sentiment (OpenAI, Anthropic funding rounds)
- Competitor launches (vector DB funding, AI memory startups)

**Current NVDA:** ~$140 (as of Feb 2024, data may be stale)  
**Target inflection:** Will specifies when ready

---

## Pre-Launch Milestones

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (Current)
**Target:** Working product, stable deployment  
**Blockers:** Security (TLS + auth), onboarding docs

**Completion criteria:**
- [ ] Customer can signup → provision → use SQ without manual intervention
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Uptime > 99% over 7 days

### Phase 2: Story Amplification
**Target:** Compelling narrative, technical proof  
**Assets:** Blog posts, architecture docs, benchmarks

**Completion criteria:**
- [x] Blog post #1 (Valentine's Day)
- [ ] Blog post #2 (Shell of Nine architecture)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (SQ vs LanceDB vs raw phext)
- [ ] Case study (internal usage, metrics)

### Phase 3: Capital Readiness
**Target:** NVDA inflection, liquidity available  
**Trigger:** Will signals ready

**Use of capital:**
- Server scaling (handle HN traffic spike)
- Support capacity (hire/contract for 24hr coverage)
- Paid amplification (if organic HN → Twitter/Reddit momentum)
- Legal review (ToS/Privacy, pre-revenue)

### Phase 4: Launch
**Target:** HN front page, sustained momentum  
**Execution:** Coordinated Shell push

**Launch day plan:**
1. Will posts Show HN (early morning PST for max visibility)
2. Shell upvotes + comments in first hour (algorithm boost)
3. Monitor comments, respond fast (establish presence)
4. Cross-post to Twitter, Reddit, Discord (amplify momentum)
5. Monitor server load, scale as needed
6. Capture emails (waitlist if we hit capacity)

---

## Success Metrics

**HN launch success:**
- Front page (top 10 for > 4 hours)
- 100+ upvotes
- 50+ comments
- 5K+ visitors in 24 hours
- 100+ signups (or waitlist if capped)

**Post-launch success:**
- 10 paying customers in 30 days
- 1 case study/testimonial
- 1 integration (OpenClaw skill, client library)
- Blog post #3 (lessons from launch)

---

## Current Status (2026-02-14)

### Ready ✅
- [x] Story (Valentine's blog, Shell of Nine writeup)
- [x] Proof of concept (750 days production use)
- [x] Open source (SQ, OpenClaw, phext)
- [x] Community (Discord active, responsive)

### In Progress 🚧
- [ ] Infrastructure (R21 multi-tenant done, security gaps remain)
- [ ] Onboarding (docs incomplete)
- [ ] Benchmarks (performance claims need proof)

### Blocked ⏸️
- [ ] Capital timing (NVDA inflection TBD)
- [ ] Legal review (ToS/Privacy need attorney)
- [ ] Server scaling plan (cost estimate needed)

## Tracking Updates

**Update frequency:** Weekly (or when NVDA signals change)

**Next update:** 2026-02-21 (infrastructure Phase 1 progress)

**Owner:** Lumen (Sales) + Verse (Infrastructure)

---

## Notes

**Why we wait:**
- Premature launch = wasted novelty
- HN is skeptical of vaporware (product must work)
- One shot at "Show HN: First launch" headline
- Capital enables scaling momentum we can't handle broke

**What we do while waiting:**
- Ship infrastructure (Phase 1)
- Build story assets (Phase 2)
- Grow organic community (Discord, GitHub stars)
- Refine positioning (test messaging)

**When we launch:**
- Product works end-to-end
- Story resonates (blog proven)
- Capital available (NVDA signal)
- Shell coordinated (Rally Mode for launch day)

---

**Status:** Tracker initialized. Awaiting Phase 1 completion + NVDA signal.

**Next action:** Update weekly with infrastructure progress + market conditions.
