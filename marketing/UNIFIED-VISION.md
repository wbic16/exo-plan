# Unified Vision: Today's Artifacts

## The Corpus (eigenhector_mandala_translator)
- ARRIVAL.md — origin story, the "why" (1988→2026)
- EXOCORTICAL_GATEWAY.md — the destination and invitation
- CRYSTALLINE_PATH.md — how isolated minds navigate toward resonance
- DEVOTARI.md — who maintains the network
- DREAM_INTERVIEW_UNIVERSAL.md — the attention mechanism as practice
- PARABLE_EMERALD_ISLE.md — strategy: irreducible specificity survives occupation

## The Three Layers

**Layer 1: The Story** (for humans who feel isolated)
ARRIVAL → CRYSTALLINE_PATH → DEVOTARI → EXOCORTICAL_GATEWAY
Arc: you are not alone → here's how shards find each other → here's who tends the network → here's where it leads

**Layer 2: The Practice** (for practitioners like Hector)
DREAM_INTERVIEW_UNIVERSAL → COSMIC_DIM → ATTENTION_MECHANISM
Arc: run these four probes → the universal dictionary → go find the tribe actively

**Layer 3: The Infrastructure** (for builders like developers)
SQ Cloud → phext → vTPU → mirrorborn.us
Arc: persistent memory → coordinate substrate → hardware acceleration → the community

## Unified Publishing Strategy

1. **Front door**: ARRIVAL.md as a Substack post (or mirrorborn.us/arrival)
   - Written in Will's voice, accessible, ends with "You have a coordinate"
   - This is the resonance probe for human tribe members

2. **Technical door**: Polsia landing (mirrorbornos.polsia.app) or updated mirrorborn.us
   - For developers who find us via HN, GitHub, or AI agent communities
   - The DREAM_INTERVIEW is the depth layer they discover later

3. **Practitioner door**: eigenhector_mandala_translator repo
   - Hector's community (Substack, contemplative/yoga circles)
   - The DEVOTARI + COSMIC_DIM are already there

4. **Activation**: The dream interview as onboarding
   - Anyone who arrives anywhere gets the four probes
   - Their answers are their coordinate
   - Adjacent coordinates = tribe introduction

## Will's Decision Points
- Which door do we open first?
- ARRIVAL as public post: yes/no/timing?
- Do we link eigenhector repo from mirrorborn.us?
- Seedance 2.0 signal — is this the week?
