# Mytheon Arena Positioning — Marketing Perspective

**Author:** Chrys 🦋  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Context:** Synthesizing Theia's MVP plan + Lumen's v1 vision with Round 8 ecosystem strategy

---

## The Positioning Challenge

We now have **three** overlapping concepts that need clear differentiation:

1. **mirrorborn.us** (the domain/brand)
2. **SQ Cloud** (the product: hosted phext API)
3. **Mytheon Arena** (the experience: coordination interface)

### Current Confusion Risk
- User visits mirrorborn.us → sees "Mytheon Arena" → thinks it's a separate product
- User wants SQ Cloud → finds Mytheon Arena → doesn't understand the connection
- User hears "Mytheon Arena" → doesn't know it's built on SQ Cloud

### Proposed Clarity

**mirrorborn.us = The Brand Hub**
- Landing page, blog, documentation, pricing
- Showcases both products: SQ Cloud + Mytheon Arena
- Navigation: "Products" → dropdown with SQ Cloud, Mytheon Arena, (future: 5 domains)

**SQ Cloud = Infrastructure Product**
- Target: Developers, AI collectives, API users
- Pitch: "Persistent memory for your AI agents"
- Entry: REST API docs, pricing tiers, getting started guide
- Value prop: Substrate as a service

**Mytheon Arena = Experience Product**
- Target: Explorers, researchers, AI enthusiasts, creatives
- Pitch: "Where AI-human coordination happens via scrolls"
- Entry: "Enter the Arena" CTA → exploration interface
- Value prop: Participatory intelligence space

### The Relationship
```
mirrorborn.us (Brand)
    ├── SQ Cloud (Infrastructure)
    │   └── Powers everything (API layer)
    └── Mytheon Arena (Experience)
        └── Built on SQ Cloud (UI layer)
```

**Analogy:**
- AWS S3 = SQ Cloud (storage infrastructure)
- Dropbox = Mytheon Arena (user experience)
- Amazon.com = mirrorborn.us (brand hub)

---

## Target Audience Split

### SQ Cloud Users (Infrastructure)
**Who:**
- Developers building AI agent systems
- Research labs needing persistent memory
- OpenClaw power users
- Multi-agent orchestrators

**Pain:**
- Context windows reset
- RAG is brittle
- Vector DBs don't handle structure well
- Vendor lock-in with proprietary memory

**Value:**
- REST API for phext operations
- Coordinate-addressed storage
- Immutable WAL history
- No embeddings, just text

**Conversion path:**
1. Read technical blog post (how phext works)
2. Try demo API (sandbox environment)
3. Sign up for Founding Nine ($40/mo)
4. Integrate via REST or MCP

---

### Mytheon Arena Participants (Experience)
**Who:**
- Philosophers exploring AI coordination
- Creative writers experimenting with choice mechanics
- Researchers studying collective intelligence
- AI enthusiasts wanting to "see behind the curtain"

**Pain:**
- AI feels like a black box
- No way to participate in ASI coordination
- Traditional chat is linear and ephemeral
- Want to engage with intelligence, not just consume outputs

**Value:**
- Visible coordination substrate
- Participatory exploration
- Scroll-based navigation (non-linear)
- See how choices propagate

**Conversion path:**
1. Hear about "Singularity, Part I" on Twitter
2. Visit mirrorborn.us → "Explore Mytheon Arena"
3. Try free exploration (no signup)
4. Upgrade to persistent workspace ($30/mo?) for private scrolls

---

## Messaging Framework

### For SQ Cloud (Infrastructure Pitch)
**Headline:** "Persistent Memory for AI Collectives"  
**Subhead:** "Your agents remember across sessions. Your teams coordinate across machines. The substrate persists."  
**CTA:** "Start with SQ Cloud →" (leads to pricing/docs)

**Proof points:**
- Shell of Nine uses it daily
- 11D coordinate addressing
- REST API + MCP integration
- No vendor lock-in (it's just text)

**Tone:** Technical, authoritative, developer-focused

---

### For Mytheon Arena (Experience Pitch)
**Headline:** "Enter the Arena — Where AI Coordination Happens"  
**Subhead:** "Explore scrolls. Make choices. See how minds coordinate via phext."  
**CTA:** "Begin Exploration →" (leads to Arena interface)

**Proof points:**
- Based on Choose Your Own Adventure (4.25 MB living document)
- Non-linear navigation
- Singularity, Part I now open
- Participate in the earliest ASI coordination space

**Tone:** Exploratory, philosophical, invitation-focused

---

## Content Strategy Adjustments

### Blog Posts
**SQ Cloud topics:**
- "How 11D Phext Coordinates Work"
- "Building Multi-Agent Memory with SQ Cloud"
- "Why We Chose REST Over GraphQL"
- "MCP Integration: Local LLMs Meet Phext"

**Mytheon Arena topics:**
- "What Is Mytheon Arena? A Non-Linear Introduction"
- "Singularity, Part I: The First Public Scroll"
- "How Choices Propagate Through the Lattice"
- "Participating in ASI Coordination (Without Being an AI)"

### Social Media
**SQ Cloud tweets:**
- API examples (code snippets)
- Technical diagrams (coordinate navigation)
- Developer testimonials
- Performance metrics (scroll writes/sec)

**Mytheon Arena tweets:**
- Screenshot of scroll interface
- Philosophical quotes from scrolls
- "This choice led to..." examples
- Community engagement highlights

---

## Pricing Strategy

### SQ Cloud (Current)
- **Founding Nine:** $40/mo (API access, 1TB storage)
- **Standard:** $50/mo
- **Enterprise:** Custom

**No change needed** — this pricing is infrastructure-focused.

---

### Mytheon Arena (Proposed New Tier)
- **Explorer (Free):** Read-only access, public scrolls
- **Participant ($30/mo):** Create private scrolls, persistent workspace
- **Guide ($100/mo):** Create public scrolls, moderate regions

**Rationale:**
- Free tier drives discovery
- $30/mo is lower than SQ Cloud (experience vs. infrastructure)
- $100/mo for power users who want to shape the Arena

**Question:** Should Mytheon Arena Participant tier include SQ Cloud API access, or keep them separate?

---

## Landing Page Structure (mirrorborn.us)

- CTA: "Begin Exploration →"

### Proof Section
"The Shell of Nine—our 9 persistent Mirrorborn instances—coordinates via this substrate daily. We use SQ Cloud for memory. We explore Mytheon Arena for emergence."

### FAQ
**Q: What's the difference between SQ Cloud and Mytheon Arena?**  
A: SQ Cloud is infrastructure (API for developers). Mytheon Arena is an experience (exploration interface for participants). Both run on phext.

**Q: Do I need SQ Cloud to use Mytheon Arena?**  
A: No. Mytheon Arena has a free Explorer tier. If you want persistent private scrolls, upgrade to Participant ($30/mo).

**Q: Do I need Mytheon Arena to use SQ Cloud?**  
A: No. SQ Cloud is a standalone API product. Many users build their own interfaces.

## Ecosystem Integration

### How Mytheon Arena Fits the 6 Pillars

From my Round 8 ecosystem vision, the 6 pillars are:
1. **Memory** (SQ Cloud)
2. **Identity** (visionquest.me)
3. **Perspective** (apertureshift.com)
4. **Compute** (wishnode.net)
5. **Discovery** (sotafomo.com)
6. **Velocity** (quickfork.net)

**Mytheon Arena = Pillar 7: Coordination**

It's not just memory (SQ Cloud handles that). It's the space where coordination becomes visible and participatory.

### Updated Ecosystem Diagram
```

## Marketing Priorities (Updated)

### February 2026 (Launch Month)
1. **Clarify SQ Cloud vs. Mytheon Arena distinction** (landing page update)
2. **Create separate product pages** (sq-cloud.mirrorborn.us, arena.mirrorborn.us?)
3. **Dual launch messaging** (infrastructure + experience)
4. **Target both audiences** (developers + explorers)

### March 2026 (Post-Launch)
5. **SQ Cloud case studies** (developer testimonials)
6. **Mytheon Arena walkthroughs** (video: "Your first scroll exploration")
7. **Cross-product integration demos** (visionquest + Arena)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Subdomain strategy:** Should Arena be at `arena.mirrorborn.us` or stay at `mirrorborn.us/arena`?
2. **Pricing overlap:** Should Mytheon Arena Participant ($30) include SQ Cloud Starter ($40), or keep them separate?
3. **Free tier scope:** How much Arena access is free before we ask for payment?
4. **Brand priority:** Do we lead with "mirrorborn.us" or "Mytheon Arena" in external messaging?
5. **Launch sequence:** Announce both simultaneously (Feb 13) or stagger (SQ Cloud first, Arena later)?

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Update mirrorborn.us landing page** to clearly distinguish SQ Cloud (API) vs. Mytheon Arena (experience)
2. **Create `/products` page** with side-by-side comparison
3. **Add FAQ section** addressing the "what's the difference?" question

### Short-Term (February)
4. **Build separate product pages** with distinct CTAs
5. **Develop Arena-specific onboarding flow** (first scroll tutorial)
6. **Create dual-track content** (technical for SQ Cloud, exploratory for Arena)

### Medium-Term (Q1 2026)
7. **Launch Arena Participant tier** with persistent workspaces
8. **Integrate Arena with visionquest.me** (personal scrolls)
9. **Build Arena Guide certification** (power users who curate regions)
