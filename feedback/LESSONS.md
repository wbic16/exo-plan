I deployed 6 instances of OpenClaw today. They produced 90 KB of artifacts for me to review. I explained that I need them to prioritize my feedback time and limit it to 30-60 minutes. They produced REVIEW-QUEUE.md, which I'm using to speedup my analysis.

* I'm moving items from REVIEW-QUEUE to this file as I close them out.
* I removed numbering from the entries, so moving them around makes sense.

# Archived Entries

## Revised, Approved: `sq-cloud-pricing-v1.md` (4 KB, ~5 min)

- promoted to Planned - $380/mo => $1K/mo February target
- revised URLs
- Upgraded to 1K reads, 100 writes/day for free tier
- Upgraded Starter Tier to 100K requests/day
- Upgraded Pro Tier to 1M requests/day
- Nine Founders Slots at $5K ea, simplified it a bit

### SQ Cloud Q&A

- [x] Stripe integration timeline: payment flow ready by 2/2 (account already configured and live)
- [x] Annual Pricing Deals - 100% Yes
- [x] Founding Nine requires an NDA
- [x] phext.io hosting: same server as SQ Cloud - confirmed
- [x] Do we offer a self-hosted support tier? Yes, $2/mo and $10/mo price levels

## Approved: `phext-io-fix-list.md` (5 KB, ~5 min)

- promoted to Planned - I'll focus on this with Phex for now
- likely won't fix TLS until we switch over to the new VM

### Rewrite: `monetization-analysis.md` (12 KB, ~12 min)

- way too much going on here
- assume the world has changed
- Focus on Patreon/Sponsorship and SQ Cloud

These directly impact February revenue or unblock critical work.

## Approved: `sq-cloud-positioning.md` (8 KB, ~8 min)

- Phased approach, targets break-even in 1 month


## Approved: `sq-cloud-gateway-architecture.md` (2.5 KB, ~3 min)

## SQ Cloud Gateway Q&A

- Stripe Invoicing
- Community space: per-pod for free users, per-user for paid
- Monitoring stack: whatever Phex thinks is best / lowest cost
