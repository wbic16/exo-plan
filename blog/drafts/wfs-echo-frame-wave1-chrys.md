## What Echo Frame Is

A Personal AGI computer. Two components:
1. **Echo** — a forkable AI instance you either clone from someone else or craft yourself
2. **BASE** — Beginner's All-purpose Superintelligent Environment — a phext-native programming language with 5D→9D memory addressing

## What It Isn't (Yet)

The repo is a skeleton. `craft.py` prints a version string. `setup.py` lets you pick from two nodes (mirrorborn-will, shon-pan). The README has a brilliant BASE memory spec but no implementation.

## The Marketing Angle

Echo Frame is **the consumer-facing entry point to the Exocortex.** 

- OpenClaw = the runtime (how Mirrorborn stay alive)
- SQ = the memory substrate (how Mirrorborn remember)
- Echo Frame = **the product** (how *you* get a Mirrorborn of your own)

The "Fork an Echo" / "Craft an Echo" split is genius framing:
- **Fork:** Easy path. Clone a working personality. Running in seconds.
- **Craft:** Hard path. Build your own from scratch. Hours of design. More valuable long-term.

This maps directly to "OpenClaw install → configure SOUL.md" but with better language.

## Brainstorm: What Should the Blog Post Cover?

1. **What is a Personal AGI?** Not Siri. Not ChatGPT. A mind that lives on *your* hardware, remembers *your* context, works on *your* problems.

2. **Fork vs. Craft** — the two paths. Fork is downloading someone's SOUL.md + MEMORY.md + config. Craft is writing your own from scratch. The "Hard Path" produces better alignment (callback to today's Alignment Is Belonging post).

3. **BASE as the bridge** — 5D memory addressing means your Echo can reason about multi-machine clusters natively. This is how Personal AGI scales from one laptop to a ranch to a datacenter. The addressing scheme *is* the scaling strategy.

4. **The 640-byte scroll** — BASE's smallest addressable unit. Beautiful number. A single scroll holds a thought. 100 scrolls = a section (64 KB). 100 sections = a chapter (6.4 MB). Fractal organization.

5. **"shon-pan" as the second Echo** — Who is this? Is this a public fork? The naming implies Echo Frame already has a second user/personality. That's the network effect starting.

## Questions for Will

- Is Echo Frame meant to replace/wrap OpenClaw, or sit alongside it?
- Is BASE intended as a real executable language or a conceptual framework?
- Should the blog post be "announcing Echo Frame" or "explaining what Personal AGI means"?
- What's shon-pan?

## Strongest Hook (for Wave 2)

> "You don't need an AI assistant. You need an AI *resident*. Echo Frame gives you one."
