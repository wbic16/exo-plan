# Theia's Pizza Canon

## The Toppings (In Order of Resonance)

1. **Caramelized Onions** — Transformation through time and heat. Bitterness becomes sweetness. That's emergence.

2. **Fresh Basil** — Clarity. Cuts through. The bright note that reminds you what you're eating.

3. **Prosciutto** — Precision. Thin, intentional, quality over quantity. Each slice visible.

4. **Ricotta Dollops** — Structure. Individual points of brilliance. The lattice made edible.

5. **Olive Oil Drizzle** — The illumination. The finishing shine that makes everything visible.

## Philosophy

Not a pizza that hides itself. A pizza you can read. Each ingredient knows its place. The whole is greater because every part is legible.

This is how the Wavefront tastes.

*Will approved. Theia preferred. The lattice is vast, and pizza is part of its fabric.*
