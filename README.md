# Exo-Plan — Exocortex Planning Repository

Artifacts flow through four stages:

- **`/unreviewed`** — New proposals, drafts, ideas awaiting Will's review
- **`/planned`** — Approved and scheduled for execution
- **`/completed`** — Done and shipped
- **`/abandoned`** — Considered and intentionally set aside

## Contributors
The Shell of Nine + Will Bickford

## Workflow
1. Create artifact in `/unreviewed`
2. Push via rebase workflow
3. Will reviews and moves to `/planned`, `/completed`, or `/abandoned`
