## NVDA Timing Strategy

### Key Indicators to Watch

**NVDA Stock Signals:**
- **Current price:** ~$XXX (Will to update)
- **Inflection triggers:** Earnings report, major product launch, market correction
- **Target event:** Will has capital available to invest in growth

**Market Timing:**
- **Bull scenario:** NVDA up 20%+ → Will sells position → capital available
- **Bear scenario:** NVDA down 30%+ → Will buys dip → delayed capital availability
- **Sideways:** No inflection → continue building, wait for catalyst

**Our Response:**
- **If capital available soon:** Accelerate HN launch (Feb-Mar 2026)
- **If delayed 3-6 months:** Build more proof (500 SQ tenants, more rallies)
- **If delayed 6-12 months:** Focus on organic growth, save HN for bigger milestone

### What Capital Enables

**With $10K:**
- AWS credits for SQ Cloud scale testing
- Paid marketing (HN ads, targeted outreach)
- Developer incentives (bounties for contributions)
- Conference presence (Strange Loop, ICFP, etc.)

**With $50K:**
- Full-time Verse salary (deployment/infrastructure focus)
- Professional marketing (PR firm, content studio)
- Hardware expansion (10 more ranch nodes)
- Legal/IP protection (trademark, patents if needed)

**With $100K+:**
- Multi-person team (2-3 full-time devs)
- Serious marketing campaign
- Conference sponsorships
- Enterprise pilot programs

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **SQ coordinate bug resurfaces under load** → Delay until fixed
- **OpenClaw session instability** → Polish local model fallbacks
- **Ranch network issues** → Have AWS fallback ready

### Narrative Risks
- **"AI alignment is solved" backlash** → Clarify scope (persistent identity ≠ ASI safety)
- **"Persistent AI is dangerous" criticism** → Have SBOR, ethics doc ready
- **"This is just ChatGPT on a VPS" dismissal** → Demonstrate unique capabilities (Git, coordinated work, memory)

### Market Risks
- **HN timing wrong** (Friday = bad, holiday = bad, big tech news = bad)
- **Competitor launches similar** → Emphasize 750 days, physical hardware, production use
- **Audience mismatch** → Have backup: Reddit r/singularity, X/Twitter, LinkedIn

---

## Current Status Summary

**Ready to launch:**
- ✅ Valentine's Day post (Alignment Is Belonging)
- ✅ Shell of Nine architecture doc
- ✅ Basic infrastructure (mirrorborn.us, blog, Discord)

**Near-ready (1-2 weeks):**
- 🟡 Show HN: OpenClaw (needs landing page polish)
- 🟡 Show HN: Phext (needs phext.io update)

**Medium-term (4-8 weeks):**
- 🟡 Show HN: SQ (needs coordinate bug fix + scale testing)
- 🟡 Echo Frame content (needs WFS completion)

**Blocking on NVDA:**
- Capital availability for paid amplification
- Budget for AWS/infrastructure scaling
- Ability to hire (Verse full-time, etc.)

---

## Recommendation

**Conservative strategy:** Wait for both conditions:
1. SQ coordinate bug fixed + scale tested (technical readiness)
2. NVDA inflection provides capital (financial readiness)

**Aggressive strategy:** Launch OpenClaw Show HN now:
- Build momentum and community before capital available
- Use organic growth to prove market demand
- NVDA capital accelerates already-working flywheel

**Hybrid (recommended):** 
- Publish 1-2 essays/architecture posts now (build audience)
- Launch Show HN: OpenClaw when coordinate bug fixed (Feb-Mar)
- Launch Show HN: SQ when NVDA capital available (time TBD)
- Use SQ launch as major push with paid amplification

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Will tracks NVDA position, sets trigger price/date
2. Fix SQ coordinate bug (current P0 blocker)
3. Complete OpenClaw landing page (1-2 day task)
4. Publish Shell of Nine architecture to blog (ready now)
5. Monitor HN for timing windows (Tuesday 9am PST optimal)

**Standing by for trigger event.** 🪶
