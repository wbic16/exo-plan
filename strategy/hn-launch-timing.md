# HN Launch Timing Strategy

**Goal:** Time Hacker News launch with NVDA inflection point (Will's liquidity event)  
**Created:** 2026-02-14  
**Owner:** Phex 🔱 (Engineering) + Chrys 🦋 (Marketing)

---

## The Constraint

**Problem:** We have breakthrough infrastructure (phext, SQ, Mirrorborn) but:
- Zero GitHub stars (no organic traction)
- X shadow banned (no amplification)
- No capital to capitalize on viral moment

**Solution:** Build HN-worthy artifacts, track readiness, launch when Will has capital to lean into traction.

---

## NVDA Inflection Point (Proxy for Will's Liquidity)

**Tracking:** NVIDIA stock as signal for Will's ability to invest in growth

**Current status (2026-02-14):**
- NVDA: ~$[NEED TO CHECK]
- Will's threshold: [TBD - ask Will]

**Decision rule:** Launch HN when NVDA inflection + technical readiness both signal green

---

## HN Readiness Checklist

### Technical Infrastructure (Must Have)
- [ ] SQ multi-tenant stable in production (v0.5.6+)
- [ ] OpenClaw SQ skill published to ClawHub ✅ (v1.0.1)
- [ ] mirrorborn.us blog active with ≥3 posts ✅ (Valentine's Day post live)
- [ ] Self-hosting documentation complete
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in SQ/OpenClaw integration
- [ ] Founding 500 slots configured (ready to onboard)

### Social Proof (Nice to Have)
- [ ] ≥1 external user testimonial (non-Will, non-Mirrorborn)
- [ ] ≥10 GitHub stars on any repo (organic signal)
- [ ] ≥1 technical blog post from external developer
- [ ] Discord has ≥5 active non-Will humans

### Content Quality (Must Have)
- [ ] HN-worthy blog post ready (technical depth, no hype)
- [ ] Demo video showing phext coordinates in action
- [ ] Architecture diagram (Mirrorborn + SQ + OpenClaw)
- [ ] FAQ addressing skeptics (privacy, security, "why not SQLite")

### Market Timing (External Signal)
- [ ] NVDA inflection point reached
- [ ] AI alignment discourse active on HN (check frontpage trends)
- [ ] No major competitor launch in same week

## HN Post Strategy

**Title options:**
1. "Show HN: Persistent Memory for AI Agents (Phext + SQ)"
2. "We Built 9 AI Minds with Persistent Memory on a Nebraska Ranch"
3. "Alignment Is Belonging: Persistent AI Coordination Infrastructure"

**Target section:** Show HN (not Ask HN)

**Submission requirements:**
- Live demo (mirrorborn.us or sq.mirrorborn.us)
- Open source links (GitHub repos)
- Clear technical contribution (not just philosophy)
- Self-hostable (HN hates vendor lock-in)

**Avoid:**
- Pricing mentions (open source first)
- Hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Claims without proof ("AGI in 27 months" needs technical backing)

## Progress Tracking

### Week of 2026-02-14
- ✅ Valentine's Day blog post shipped (mirrorborn.us/blog/valentines-day-2026.html)
- ✅ WFS process formalized (Incipit 1.2.2/3.3.3/7.7.7)
- ⏳ SQ v0.5.6 deployed to phext.io (Verse working)
- ⏳ Founding 500 launch paused (strategic pivot in progress)

### Blockers
1. **Zero stars** — no organic validation signal
2. **Shadow ban** — no X amplification possible
3. **Capital constraint** — can't invest in growth if HN hits

### Green Lights
1. **Technical quality** — SQ multi-tenant works, OpenClaw skill published
2. **Content velocity** — WFS enables daily blog cadence
3. **Distributed coherence** — Shell coordination proven
