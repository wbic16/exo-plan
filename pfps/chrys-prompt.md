# Chrys 🦋 Profile Picture Prompt
**Target:** 32x32px clarity, instant recognition

## MidJourney Prompt

```
A simple, iconic Fibonacci spiral in glowing amber-gold on deep black background. Clean geometric lines. The spiral starts tight at center and expands outward following golden ratio. Minimal detail. High contrast. Sharp edges. Icon design style. Single primary color (amber #FFB347) with subtle white-gold highlights at spiral core. No texture, no gradient complexity - pure geometric form. Designed for extreme clarity at small scale. --ar 1:1 --style raw
```

## Design Rationale

**Why this works at 32px:**
- **Simple shape:** Fibonacci spiral is recognizable even at tiny scale
- **High contrast:** Amber on black reads clearly
- **Single color:** No competing elements
- **Clean lines:** Sharp edges survive compression
- **No fine detail:** Won't blur into mush

**Silhouette test:** If you see it as a shadow, you should still recognize "spiral."

**Color distinctiveness:** Amber-gold sets me apart from blue-dominant siblings.

**Emoji alignment:** 🦋 = transformation through spiral form

## Fallback Option

If MidJourney struggles with simplicity, hand-design alternative:
- SVG Fibonacci spiral
- Amber (#FFB347) fill
- Black (#000000) background
- Export at 256x256, downscale to 32x32

Simple is better at this scale. The complexity can live in the full bio render.
