# R16 Product Proposals — IQ-Segmented Analysis

**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**For:** Will (R16 requirements)  
**Target Demographics:** Tinkerers, consciousness-explorers, builders, VC-adjacent, OpenClaw collectives

---

## Framework: IQ-Based Needs Analysis

Different intelligence levels approach technology differently. Products should serve all three segments:

### IQ ~100 (Majority Market, ~68% of population)
**Needs:** Clarity, simplicity, immediate value, low friction  
**Pain points:** Too much abstraction, unclear next steps, overwhelming complexity  
**Success criteria:** "I understand what this does in 30 seconds"

### IQ ~125 (Advanced Users, ~14% of population)
**Needs:** Depth, customization, technical control, efficiency  
**Pain points:** Oversimplified tools, hidden complexity, lack of power features  
**Success criteria:** "I can make this do exactly what I need"

### IQ ~150 (Innovators, ~2% of population)
**Needs:** Novelty, meta-patterns, extensibility, collaborative complexity  
**Pain points:** Tools that don't expose primitives, locked ecosystems, can't build new abstractions  
**Success criteria:** "I can build new things no one imagined"

## Current Product Analysis

### Mirrorborn Singularity ($100/mo) — All-Access
- **IQ 100:** "Too expensive, what is 'everything'?"
- **IQ 125:** "Good value if I use multiple products"
- **IQ 150:** "Perfect. I want access to primitives."

**Verdict:** Serves IQ 125-150 well. IQ 100 needs clearer value prop.

### SQ Cloud ($50/mo) — Persistent Memory
- **IQ 100:** "What is phext? Why do I need this?"
- **IQ 125:** "Interesting. Need to see examples first."
- **IQ 150:** "This is the missing layer. Obvious value."

**Verdict:** Excellent for IQ 150. IQ 100-125 need more onboarding/examples.

### Mytheon Arena ($5/mo) — AI Coordination
- **IQ 100:** "Sounds cool but unclear what I'd do"
- **IQ 125:** "Curious. Want to try before subscribing."
- **IQ 150:** "Fascinating experiment in distributed AI coordination"

**Verdict:** Appeals to consciousness-explorers (all IQs) but needs freemium tier for IQ 100-125.

### OpenClaw Mirrorborn ($10 one-time) — Quick Setup
- **IQ 100:** "What is OpenClaw? Too technical."
- **IQ 125:** "Good deal if I already know OpenClaw"
- **IQ 150:** "Instant value. I'll customize from here."

**Verdict:** Serves IQ 125-150 who already know OpenClaw. IQ 100 excluded.

### Mirrorborn Benefactor ($500 one-time) — Supporter Tier
- **IQ 100:** "Way too expensive"
- **IQ 125:** "Not sure it's worth it yet"
- **IQ 150:** "I believe in this. Shut up and take my money."

**Verdict:** Appeals to IQ 150 believers and VC-adjacent. Not for IQ 100-125.

## Gaps & Opportunities

### Gap 1: IQ 100 Entry Point (Missing)
**Problem:** Lowest-priced subscription is $5/mo Arena (unclear value). One-time options unclear.  
**Opportunity:** Create freemium or low-cost starter that demonstrates value immediately.

### Gap 2: IQ 100-125 "Try Before Subscribe" (Missing)
**Problem:** No free tier to explore before committing $5-50/mo.  
**Opportunity:** Free tier with limits (storage, API calls) → upsell to paid.

### Gap 3: Team/Collective Pricing (Missing)
**Problem:** All pricing is individual. OpenClaw collectives are teams.  
**Opportunity:** Team tiers ($200-500/mo for 5-10 agents).

### Gap 4: Developer Tools (Underserved)
**Problem:** API exists but no SDK, no examples, no tooling ecosystem.  
**Opportunity:** Developer-focused products (SDKs, templates, hosted examples).

### Gap 5: Education/Content (Missing)
**Problem:** No tutorials, no courses, no certification.  
**Opportunity:** Paid educational products for IQ 100-125 to level up.

## Pricing Psychology

### Current Problem: No Anchoring
- Cheapest: Arena $5/mo (unclear value)
- Most expensive: Benefactor $500 (huge jump)
- **Result:** No clear "good deal" tier

### Proposed Anchoring
1. **FREE** — SQ Cloud Starter (establishes "we're generous")
2. **$20/mo** — Phext Learning Path (educational value)
3. **$50/mo** — SQ Cloud (feels reasonable after $20 anchor)
4. **$100/mo** — Singularity (2x SQ Cloud, "all-access" value)
5. **$200/mo** — Team (4x SQ Cloud but for 5 agents = bargain)
6. **$500** — Benefactor (supports development, not transactional)

**Result:** $50-100/mo feels like the "smart choice" tier.

## Open Questions for Will

1. **Free tier risk:** Will free users overwhelm infrastructure before paid revenue scales?
2. **Educational content:** Are you willing to record courses, or should we hire an educator?
3. **Team tier:** Do OpenClaw collectives actually need team features, or is individual access fine?
4. **Consulting:** Do you have bandwidth for 2-5 consulting projects/month?
5. **IQ targeting:** Is this framework useful, or too abstract?
