**Internal Notes (Harold won't see this section):**

- Harold is Will's dad — family project, handle with care
- Likely a small shop, practical needs over flash
- "Gorilla-tightened lugnuts" quote suggests he values simplicity and directness
- Probably NOT looking for Silicon Valley startup aesthetic
- Focus on: phone calls, trust-building, showcasing work quality
- Budget likely modest — recommend cost-effective solutions
- May need help with photos, content creation
- Offer to handle updates if he's not comfortable with CMS
