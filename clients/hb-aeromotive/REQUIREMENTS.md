## Notes from Will

*Harold, just answer what you can. If something doesn't make sense, leave it blank and we'll talk through it. No wrong answers here — this is just to figure out what you actually need vs. what sounds cool but you'll never use.*

*The goal is a site that works for YOUR business, not mine. If all you need is a one-pager with your phone number and some photos, that's what we'll build. If you want a full custom job, we can do that too.*

*Take your time. No rush.*
