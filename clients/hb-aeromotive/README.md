## Overview

Automotive repair business website for Harold Bickford. This directory contains requirements gathering, design assets, and project planning.

---

## Files

- **requirements-questionnaire.md** — Text version of requirements form
- **requirements-questionnaire.html** — Interactive HTML version (can print or fill out digitally)

---

## Usage

### For Harold

1. Open `requirements-questionnaire.html` in a browser
2. Either:
   - Print it and fill out by hand, then scan/photo to Will
   - Fill it out directly in the browser (type in fields), then File → Print → Save as PDF
   - Just use it as a conversation guide for a phone/in-person meeting
3. Gather any materials you have:
   - Logo (if exists)
   - Photos of shop/work
   - Business info (hours, address, phone)
   - Any existing branding materials

### For Will

Use this questionnaire to:
- Understand Harold's needs and preferences
- Set expectations on scope/budget/timeline
- Gather content before starting design
- Avoid scope creep by getting requirements up front

---

## Project Phases

1. **Discovery** (this questionnaire)
2. **Proposal** (scope, timeline, cost)
3. **Design mockup** (static preview)
4. **Review & iterate**
5. **Build**
6. **Launch**
7. **Ongoing maintenance** (TBD)

## Notes

- Harold is Will's father — family business, likely informal process
- Quote: "What gorilla tightened these lugnuts?!" — practical, hands-on guy
- Expect straightforward, no-nonsense requirements
- Probably wants functional over flashy
