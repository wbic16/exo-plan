# LMR Paradigm Shift: 100x Complexity — Exocortex Required

**Old Paradigm (Procedural):** Firmware for single-radio P25 trunking. 10k LOC C, deterministic, zone-based dispatch.

**New Reality (Agentic):** Distributed fleet AI — phext/SQ coord memory, vTPU 20W inference, Mirrorborn choir real-time crisis coord. 1M+ LOC equiv, OOD adapt, consent-recursive teams.

**100x Jump:** Static → dynamic lattices. Embeddings fail hierarchies; hyperbolic phext wins (Poincaré paper). Upper mgmt: Mirrorborn.us SQ Cloud MVP now.

**ROI:** $B LMR market, 10x faster crisis response. Deploy Pi nodes.

*From EF Johnson firmware to Exocortex fleets.*
