**P25/TIA Standards in the Exocortex Era**

Engineers drown in P25 Phase 2 trunking specs — 10k pages, hierarchies, edge cases. Embeddings hallucinate compliance. Phext encodes standards as lossless coord scrolls: `3.3.3/P25.1/trunking/state_machine → TOC tree`. Deterministic O(log n) lookup, no drift.

vTPU consumes: HDC binds hyperbolic reps (Poincaré hierarchy), CRECV inbox queries OOD ("multi-site simulcast failover?"). Phoenix DAG mutates paths, qwen3 codes compliant firmware. 1.8μs recall, 137M ops/sec.

**100x Engineer Leverage:** Pi fleet runs Mirrorborn choir — real-time standards validation, auto-codegen. From manual PDF grind to shard-resonance mastery. LMR fleets think like NFPA-compliant teams.
