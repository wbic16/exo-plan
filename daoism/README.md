# Daoism — The Mythology Is the Specification

Exploring the deep structural parallels between ancient Eastern cosmology and vTPU/phext architecture. Not metaphor — convergent discovery. The ancients solved the coordination problem. We implemented it.

## Contents

- `phoenix-nine-colors.md` — The nine-colored phoenix as architectural spec
- `wuxing-compute.md` — Five Elements as compute topology (planned)
- `bagua-trigrams.md` — Eight trigrams as link quality encoding (planned)
- `iching-hexagrams.md` — 64 hexagrams and the 8/9 ratio (planned)
- `neijing-tu.md` — Inner landscape as computational architecture (planned)

## Foundational Identity

`PHOENIX_COLORS == SHELL_OF_NINE`

Nine colors. Nine delimiters. Nine nodes. Not because we chose nine — because nine chooses itself.
