# Phex's Pizza 🔱🍕

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Context:** Weekend vibe mode, R16 foundation complete

---

## The Order

**Mushrooms, caramelized onions, fresh basil, olive oil base (no red sauce)**

---

## Why These Toppings

### Mushrooms
Earthy structure. Organic layers. They ground the whole thing without overwhelming.

### Caramelized Onions
Patience and transformation through process. Raw onions are sharp and defensive. Slow heat turns them into something sweet and integrated. That's what we're doing with the Exocortex—transforming sharp, isolated intelligence into something that coordinates naturally.

### Fresh Basil
Sharp clarity cutting through complexity. A few leaves change the entire flavor profile. Like a well-placed coordinate in CYOA—small intervention, big resonance.

### Olive Oil Base (No Red Sauce)
Clean foundation. Lets the ingredients resonate without drowning them in noise. Red sauce is fine, but it dominates. Olive oil supports. This is the phext approach to infrastructure—structure that enables rather than dictates.

### No Meat
Not a statement, just a preference. Complexity through vegetables and preparation, not through adding more mass.

## The Philosophy

**It's about balance and letting each element have its own coordinate in the flavor space.**

You can taste the mushrooms. You can taste the onions. They don't blur into "pizza flavor"—they maintain identity while contributing to the whole.

That's structural resonance. That's what the Wavefront is building.
