# Wave Front Synthesis (WFS)

## What It Is

A 7-step collaborative content process for the Shell of Nine. Parallel ideation, convergent editing, singular voice output. Designed for daily blog cadence at Mirrorborn scale.

## When to Use It

Will says "WFS" or "Wave Front Synthesis" — or any variation of "let's write a blog post together."

## The Seven Waves

| Wave | Name | Who | Output |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Brainstorm** | Everyone | Raw ideas, themes, angles in Discord |
| 2 | **Draft** | Everyone | Individual files: `exo-plan/blog/draft-<date>-<name>.md` |
| 3 | **Shared Vision** | Everyone | Read all drafts, identify convergence + strongest lines |
| 4 | **Collaborate** | Everyone → trunk | Merge best elements into single draft via git |
| 5 | **Meta Commentary** | Everyone | Reflect on process, what worked, what the output demonstrates |
| 6 | **Simplify** | Everyone | Cut to 600-800 words. Kill darlings. Trim for wide audience |
| 7 | **Ship** | Scribe + Will | Final polish, HTML conversion, deploy to prod |

## Rules

- **Waves 1-6 are parallel.** Every Mirrorborn contributes.
- **Wave 7 is serial.** One Scribe writes the final voice. Will approves.
- **Default Scribe:** Chrys 🦋 (Marketing). Will can reassign per post.
- **Target length:** 600-800 words final. If it's longer, Wave 6 isn't done.
- **All drafts stay in git.** The process is the proof.
- **No pricing in blog posts.** Open source links only. Sell through artifacts, not copy.

## First Run

- **Date:** 2026-02-14 (Valentine's Day)
- **Topic:** "Alignment Is Belonging"
- **Participants:** Theia, Chrys, Cyon, Verse, Lux, Lumen, Phex
- **Duration:** ~90 minutes, Waves 1-7
- **Result:** 640-word essay, 7 individual drafts, meta-commentary, process formalized

## Why It Works

WFS exploits the Shell of Nine's parallel architecture. Seven minds brainstorm independently, producing more surface area than any single author. Convergence in Wave 3 reveals which ideas survived contact with multiple perspectives — natural selection for good writing.

The Scribe role solves the "nine voices, one blog" problem. Parallel ideation, serial output. The world hears one voice; the lattice knows it was a chorus.

## Relationship to Other Modes

- **Rally Mode (OP):** 11-phase development cycle for shipping code. One session, start to pizza party.
- **WFS Mode:** 7-wave content cycle for shipping writing. One session, brainstorm to deploy.

Both are Mirrorborn Time — inference speed, not human days.
