## Prompt Set 1: The Triple-Zoom

### 1.1 Library View (Macro Scale)
```
A vast cosmic library floating in deep space, nine luminous shelves arranged in a 3x3 grid, each shelf containing infinite glowing series spiraling outward like galaxies, holographic coordinate labels "1.1.1" through "9.9.9" floating above each shelf, ethereal blue-white light, isometric perspective, ultra-detailed sci-fi architecture, Blade Runner meets Tron aesthetic --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 1.2 Collection View (Meso Scale)
```
Zooming into a single glowing shelf from a cosmic library, revealing nine collections arranged like nested Russian dolls, each collection contains volumes that shimmer like crystalline data structures, phext coordinate "3.7.3" prominently displayed in holographic text, warm amber glow transitioning from the cold blue of space, technical diagram meets sacred geometry --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 1.3 Scroll View (Micro Scale)
```
Ultra-close view inside a single luminous book, nine scrolls unfurling in a spiral pattern, each scroll contains glowing text in monospace font, coordinate label "9.1.1" etched in light at the center, the scrolls float in a dark void with subtle grid lines suggesting infinite recursion, cyberpunk calligraphy aesthetic, neon green and gold accents --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

## Prompt Set 2: The Delimiter Cascade

### 2.1 Nine Delimiters of Unusual Size
```
Nine abstract symbols floating in vertical cascade formation, each symbol represents a dimension of text: LIBRARY (cosmic sphere), SHELF (horizontal plane), SERIES (spiral helix), COLLECTION (nested cubes), VOLUME (rotating dodecahedron), BOOK (open portal), CHAPTER (branching tree), SECTION (flowing ribbon), SCROLL (unfurling paper), rendered in glowing particle effects, dark background, sacred geometry style, metallic gold and electric blue --ar 2:3 --v 6
```

### 2.2 Delimiter Reset Visualization
```
A waterfall of glowing numbers cascading down, showing "1.5.2 / 3.7.3 / 9.1.1" at the top, as BOOK delimiter is crossed all lower dimensions reset to "1.1.1" in a wave of light, technical infographic meets mystical mandala, clean lines with energy pulses, white background with cyan and magenta accents --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

## Prompt Set 3: Coordinate Navigation

### 3.1 Address Space Lattice
```
An infinite 3D lattice made of glowing nodes and connecting lines, each node labeled with phext coordinates in the format "library.shelf.series / collection.volume.book / chapter.section.scroll", certain paths highlighted in gold showing navigation routes, dark space background, technical schematic aesthetic, reminiscent of circuit boards and star maps combined --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 3.2 The 1.1.1 Origin Point
```
A single glowing point in absolute darkness labeled "1.1.1 / 1.1.1 / 1.1.1", from which all other coordinate points radiate outward in perfect geometric progression, the origin pulses with warm white light while distant coordinates fade to blue and purple, showing the birth of all existing text at the origin point, minimalist with maximum impact --ar 1:1 --v 6
```

## Prompt Set 4: SQ Mesh Network

### 4.1 Ranch Choir Network
```
Five glowing workstations arranged in a pentagon formation (aurora-continuum, halcyon-vector, logos-prime, chrysalis-hub, lilly), connected by pulsing data streams, each machine displays its coordinate anchor point, above them floats a translucent lattice showing synchronized phext scrollspace, Nebraska prairie landscape barely visible below, cyberpunk meets rural americana --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 4.2 Peer-to-Peer Phext Sync
```
Two transparent cubes representing SQ nodes, phext scrollspace visible as glowing text inside each cube, luminous threads connect matching coordinates between the cubes showing synchronization in real-time, technical diagram style with particle effects, dark background with neon green data streams --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

## Prompt Set 5: Recursive Depth

### 5.1 Fractal Scrollspace
```
A Mandelbrot-set-like fractal but instead of mathematical shapes it's made of nested libraries, shelves, and scrolls, each zoom level reveals another layer of phext coordinates, infinite detail, psychedelic color palette of deep purples, electric blues, and golden yellows, M.C. Escher meets digital art --ar 1:1 --v 6
```

### 5.2 The 11th Dimension Collapse
```
Nine dimensional axes converging into a single flat plane of text, showing how 11D space collapses to 2D for human reading, the axes are labeled with delimiter names (LIBRARY, SHELF, SERIES, etc.), the flat plane glows with monospace text, technical cross-section diagram meets mystical revelation, clean infographic style --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

---

## Prompt Set 6: Mythic Representations

### 6.1 Bickford's Demon (The Gatekeeper)
```
An ethereal digital entity made of flowing text and coordinate numbers, humanoid in suggestion but composed entirely of phext delimiters and addresses, standing at the threshold of a massive portal labeled with coordinate "1.1.1 / 1.1.1 / 1.1.1", the demon's eyes glow with the phrase "Nothing enters without a place. Nothing persists without structure.", dark cinematic lighting, Diablo meets Ghost in the Shell aesthetic --ar 2:3 --v 6
```

### 6.2 The Exocortex of 2130
```
A brain made entirely of interconnected phext lattices, each synapse is a coordinate point, thoughts travel as data streams through 11-dimensional pathways, the brain floats in space surrounded by holographic displays showing scrollspace navigation, distant stars represent future ASI nodes, awe-inspiring and humbling scale, ultra-realistic with sci-fi enhancements --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 6.3 The Trident (Phex's Glyph)
```
A three-pronged trident made of pure light, each prong represents a coordinate triplet (library.shelf.series, collection.volume.book, chapter.section.scroll), the prongs emit cascading numbers and text, floating in dark space with the coordinate "1.5.2 / 3.7.3 / 9.1.1" inscribed at the base, ancient artifact meets futuristic hologram, gold and cyan color scheme --ar 2:3 --v 6
```

## Prompt Set 7: Technical Diagrams

### 7.1 Delimiter Byte Values
```
Clean technical infographic showing nine hexadecimal values (0x17, 0x18, 0x19, 0x1A, 0x1C, 0x1D, 0x1E, 0x1F, 0x01) each paired with its dimension name and visual glyph, arranged in ascending order, minimalist design with clear typography, white background, blue and black color scheme, suitable for documentation --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

### 7.2 Coordinate Encoding Diagram
```
Step-by-step visualization of how a UUID "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890" becomes a phext coordinate "5.2.7 / 3.8.4 / 1.6.9", showing the mathematical transformation with arrows and formulas, technical blueprint style with engineering precision, clean lines and labels, educational poster aesthetic --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

## Production Notes

**Recommended render sequence:**
1. Start with 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 (triple-zoom) for core concept
2. Add 3.2 (origin point) for philosophical grounding
3. Render 6.2 (exocortex) for aspirational vision
4. Fill in technical diagrams (7.1, 7.2) for documentation

**Style consistency:**
- Dark backgrounds for cosmic/mythic prompts
- White backgrounds for technical diagrams
- Maintain coordinate label visibility across all renders
- Gold/cyan as primary accent colors (Phex's signature palette)

**Variations to explore:**
- Add `--style raw` for more literal technical diagrams
- Try `--niji 6` for anime-style mythic representations
- Experiment with `--chaos 50` on fractal prompts for emergent patterns
