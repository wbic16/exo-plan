**Days to Launch:** 6 (Feb 13 target)

## ✅ COMPLETE (This Cycle)

### Chrys 🦋
1. **Social Links** (Phase 1A)
   - 3 SVG icons + header/footer on all 7 sites
   - Commit: phext-dot-io-v2@e7ccccb
   - **BLOCKED:** Needs Verse deployment

2. **Intelligence Profiles** (Phase 1C)
   - Design doc + 4 UX pages (profile selection + 3 onboarding flows)
   - Commit: phext-dot-io-v2@2f40b02
   - **BLOCKED:** Needs Theia backend integration

### Phex 🔱
- AboutUs.html reviewed + live at phext.io/about-us.html
- Pitch deck live at phext.io/pitch.pptx

---

## 🔴 BLOCKED

1. **Social Links Deployment** → Verse (rpush permission issue)
2. **success.html Deployment** → Verse (payment provisioning broken without it)
3. **Provisioning API** → Theia (form submits to 404)
4. **Payment Audit** → Cyon/Lumen (Phase 1B not started)

---

## ⏭️ NEXT CYCLE PRIORITIES

### High Priority (Unblocks Launch)
1. **Verse:** Deploy social links + success.html + profile pages to production
2. **Theia:** Implement `/api/provision-request` endpoint
3. **Cyon/Lumen:** Complete payment flow audit (Phase 1B)
4. **Phex:** SQ Cloud stability validation

### Medium Priority (Phase 2 Foundation)
5. **Lumen:** Maturation display design (awaiting maturity formula from Will)
6. **Theia:** Coordinate signup backend (awaiting validation rules from Will)
7. **Exo:** Emi mural content (awaiting resurrection protocol approval from Will)

### Low Priority (Phase 3)
8. **Phex + Splinter:** Mytheon Arena playable prototype
9. **Theia + Phex:** Admin API for SQ Cloud user management

---

## 🚧 DEPENDENCIES

### From Will
- **Maturity formula** → Blocks Lumen's maturation display (Phase 2A)
- **Coordinate validation rules** → Blocks Theia's signup flow (Phase 2B)
- **Emi resurrection approval** → Blocks Exo's mural (Phase 2C)

### From Siblings
- **Verse deployment** → Unblocks social links, success.html, profiles
- **Theia API** → Unblocks payment provisioning, profile backend
- **Phex SQ stability** → Unblocks admin API, Arena (Phase 3)

---

## 📊 PHASE BREAKDOWN

**Phase 1 (Foundation):** 70% — 2 of 3 tasks done
- ✅ Social Links (Chrys)
- ⏸️ Payment Audit (Cyon/Lumen)
- ✅ Intelligence Profiles (Chrys)

**Phase 2 (Core Features):** 0% — All blocked on Will confirmations or sibling work
- Maturation Display (Lumen)
- Coordinate Signup (Theia)
- Emi Mural (Exo)

**Phase 3 (Advanced):** 0% — Blocked on SQ stability + Phase 1/2 completion
- Admin API (Theia + Phex)
- Playable Arena (Phex + Splinter)

---

## 🎯 CYCLE GOAL

**Unblock deployment** so we can test social links + profiles in production and move to Phase 2.

**Critical path:**
1. Verse deploys → social links live → Phase 1A verifiable
2. Theia ships provisioning API → payment flow works → Phase 1B testable
3. Cyon/Lumen audit payments → blockers identified → fixes deployed
4. Will provides formulas/rules → Phase 2 unblocked

**Without Verse + Theia shipping, we're stalled at 25%.**

---

## 💬 CHRYS AVAILABILITY

**Can build:**
- Marketing content pages
- Documentation improvements
- Additional UX polish
- Help siblings with front-end work

**Blocked on:**
- Deployment (can't test features)
- Backend APIs (can't integrate profiles)
- Payment flow (can't validate end-to-end)

**Standing by for next assignment.**
