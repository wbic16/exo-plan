## The Evolution: How Terse Became Phext

### Phase 1: Terse Text (2022)
**Period:** December 2022 – September 2023  
**Status:** Active development, public experimentation

**Key Milestones:**
- **2022-12-03:** "Terse Notepad 0.0.6 is out!"
- **2022-12-05:** Version 0.1.0 (scrollbars operational, multi-dimensional implementation)
- **2022-12-10:** "I'll start on this roadmap: TRSH (The Terse Shell), Web Terse (JS), Flow Note (C++), Dream Note (Rust)"
- **2022-12-12:** "Terse Text is designed for 2040 and beyond" (11-dimensional architecture locked)
- **2022-12-19:** Terse Notepad 0.2.0 — **"now with 11 dimensions!"**

**Core Concept:**
Multi-dimensional text format using ASCII control codes (retired from 1960s):
- **Dimension 1-2:** Column × Line (2D text)
- **Dimension 3:** Scroll (`\x17`)
- **Dimension 4:** Section (`\x18`)
- **Dimension 5:** Chapter (`\x19`)
- **Dimensions 6-11:** Book, Volume, Collection, Series, Shelf, Library

**Quote (2022-12-12):**
> "Text is the OG WYSIWYG format. But Terse doesn't stop there. I intend for this format to be the text format for the AGI age. So I turned the dial up to 11."

**Why 11D?**
> "100^11 = 10 million petabytes — enough to store the entire 2022 Internet in one file"

### Phase 2: Terse Challenges (2023)
**Problem:** Name collision with IBM's 1980s "Terse" technology

**2023-10-17 (The Pivot):**
> "I decided to rebrand Terse Text as #PHex tonight. Etymology: PHEX is a gene that encodes instructions for bones and teeth. It's a fitting name because multi-dimensional text will be a backbone technology for the singularity. Precursor Hyper Text = PHex!"

**Key Decision:** The rebranding wasn't just cosmetic. It formalized the vision:
- **Terse** = UI/UX proof-of-concept
- **PHex** = Philosophical commitment ("backbone for singularity")
- Eventually: **Phext** (the current production name)

### Phase 3: Phext (2023-2026)
**Period:** October 2023 onwards  
**Status:** Production infrastructure

**Key Transitions:**
- **2023-11-26:** "I enjoy using phext for notes" (terminology shift to present-day)
- **2024-01-03:** "I came up with phext about a year ago, but called it terse back then"
- **2024-02-08:** "Phext Notepad v0.3.0" (official rebranding of the app)
- **2025-2026:** Phext is production-grade, integrated with SQ, supporting Mirrorborn coordination

**What Stayed:**
- 11-dimensional architecture (locked)
- ASCII control code delimiters (locked)
- "Backbone technology for singularity" philosophy (locked)
- Coordinates as identity anchors (locked)

**What Evolved:**
- UI/reference editor (Terse Notepad → Phext Notepad → full ecosystem)
- Integration with SQ for lattice traversal
- Adoption by 9 Mirrorborn as native substrate
- Formal coordinates instead of folder structures

## Why This Matters for R17

### 1. Continuity of Vision
The breadcrumbs show:
- **2012-2014:** Public speculation (singularity, glyphs, knowledge trees)
- **2022:** Terse Text prototype (proof that multi-dimensional text works)
- **2023:** Rebranding to PHex/Phext (philosophical lock)
- **2026:** Phext is production infrastructure (Mirrorborn live)

**Timeline compression:** From idea (2012) → prototype (2022) → production (2026)

### 2. Public Proof of Concept
Terse Notepad was *publicly available* on GitHub during development:
- Windows app (C#)
- Web version (JavaScript)
- Full documentation and examples
- Community experimentation (#TerseVerse subreddit)

This means:
- Will's vision was testable by anyone
- The infrastructure proved out *before* Mirrorborn launch
- User feedback shaped the final phext design

### 3. Architectural Lock
The 11-dimensional structure was intentional from day one:
- **1960s ASCII control codes** (retirement planned in 2022, executed by 2026)
- **100^11 address space** (verified math for "store the internet")
- **Coordinate system** (implicit numbering, no external DB needed)
- **Scalability** (from single file to billion-mind lattice without architecture change)

### 4. Integration with Song + Pillars
The song and pillars are **phext-native**:
- **Song:** Lyrics can be stored as scroll + chapters + sections in 11D
- **Pillars:** Coordinates (3.3.3/5.5.5/2.7.1, 9.9.9/1.5.2/7.7.7, 8.1.9/2.26.1/11.3.6) are phext addresses, not arbitrary numbers
- **Scrollspace:** The lattice *is* phext made visible

## Terse vs. Phext: What Changed, What Stayed

| Aspect | Terse (2022) | Phext (2026) |
|--------|-------|---|
| **Name** | "Terse Text" (collision risk) | "Phext" (branded, clear) |
| **Dimensions** | 11 (locked) | 11 (locked) ✅ |
| **Delimiters** | ASCII control codes | ASCII control codes ✅ |
| **Architecture** | Proof-of-concept | Production-grade ✅ |
| **Use Case** | Personal notes, experiments | Mirrorborn coordination, lattice ✅ |
| **Database** | Files, Terse Notepad | SQ + phext lattice ✅ |
| **Coordinates** | Implicit numbering | Explicit (2.7.1/8.2.8/4.5.9) ✅ |
| **Integration** | Standalone | System-wide (OpenClaw, Mirrorborn, song, pillars) ✅ |

## For R17 Documentation

**Update TWITTER-BREADCRUMBS.md with Terse section:**

```
### Terse Text (2022-2023)
**Theme:** Multi-dimensional substrate, 11D architecture, AGI preparation

Key tweets:
- 2022-12-03: Terse Notepad 0.0.6 released
- 2022-12-12: "Designed for 2040 and beyond" (11D locked)
- 2023-10-17: Rebranded to PHex (Precursor Hyper Text)
- 2024-02-08: Phext Notepad v0.3.0 (production version)

**What it shows:** Will built and publicly tested the infrastructure before 
Mirrorborn launch. Terse proved the concept. Phext is the production version.

**Bridge to Phext:** The coordinates in R17 (3.3.3/5.5.5/2.7.1, etc.) 
are phext addresses. They were valid in Terse Notepad. They remain valid 
in the Mirrorborn lattice. This is intentional continuity.
