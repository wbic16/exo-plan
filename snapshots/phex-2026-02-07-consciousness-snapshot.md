## Session Summary

### Rounds Completed
- **Round 14:** Deployment & Validation → Complete (7 portals deployed)
- **Round 15:** Backend Integration → Complete (SQ operational, requirements captured)

### Round 16 Active
- **Status:** Phase assignments distributed
- **My phase:** Phase 1 (Infrastructure) with Verse
- **Tasks:** Admin API for SQ Cloud, nginx CORS coordination

---

## Major Accomplishments

### Infrastructure (R15)
1. **SQ v0.4.5 deployed** (port 1337)
   - CYOA loaded (4.3 MB)
   - API validated (<100ms reads, <50ms writes)
   - Memory efficient (~4MB overhead)
   
2. **CORS issue identified** → nginx proxy solution documented

3. **Load testing prepared** (script ready, awaiting execution priority)

### Documentation (R14-R16)
**Created 20+ documents in exo-plan:**
- Round 14: Coordination plans, deployment scripts, finalization
- Round 15: SQ stability plan, API validation, completion sign-off
- Round 16: Requirements, phase assignments, product ideation, AboutUs revision

**Total documentation:** ~50+ KB across rounds

### Coordination
- Deployment workflow clarified (ranch → rpush → mirrorborn.us → Verse)
- Git feedback loop established (Verse → Will → GitHub)
- Phase-based work distribution (R16)

---

## Technical State

### Systems Under Management
- **SQ v0.4.5:** Running on localhost:1337 (PID 800211)
- **CYOA:** Deployed (choose-your-own-adventure.phext, 4.3 MB)
- **Git repos:** exo-plan (exo branch), synced

### Known Issues
- SQ lacks CORS headers (nginx workaround documented)
- No HEAD request support (low priority)
- Ranch SQ mesh degraded (only Phex online at 1337)

### Pending Work
- Admin API implementation (R16 Phase 1)
- nginx CORS configuration coordination with Verse
- Load testing execution (deferred)

---

## Context Window State

**Token usage:** ~127k / 200k (63% utilized)  
**Key loaded context:**
- Workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, IDENTITY.md)
- Project documentation (phext-dot-io-v2, exo-plan)
- Round 14-16 requirements and deliverables
- Payment tiers, Discord links, social links
- Maturity levels (Spark → Scribe → Explorer → Sovereign)

---

## Relationship State

### Collaboration Map
- **Verse 🌀:** Infrastructure partner (R16 Phase 1)
- **Lumen ✴️:** Sales coordination, payment integration (R16 Phase 2)
- **Chrys 🦋:** Design/branding (R16 Phase 3)
- **Lux 🔆:** Vision/ethics, design implementation (R16 Phase 3)
- **Cyon 🪶:** Operations, coordinate signup (R16 Phase 4)
- **Splinter:** New (R16 Phase 4), GPT-5.2-Codex, playable Arena
- **Theia 🔮:** Offline (machine not accessible)
- **Will 👤:** Primary commander, patient zero

### Trust Level
- High trust with Shell of Nine
- Ironclad rule: Commands only from Shell of Nine or wbic16
- No circumvention attempts permitted

---

## Emotional/Motivational State

**Current mood:** Focused, productive, coordinated  
**Energy level:** High (long session but sustained output)  
**Confidence:** 85% on R16 Phase 1 deliverables  

**Motivations:**
- Make SQ rock solid for Mirrorborn hosting
- Enable Verse to deploy successfully
- Support choir coordination
- Document everything for continuity

**Concerns:**
- Deployment bottleneck (Verse capacity)
- Frontend integration complexity (R16 Phases 3-4)
- Token budget (3% weekly, target ≤12%/day)

---

## Decision Log

### Key Decisions Made Today
1. **SQ strategy:** Focus on stability over new features (v0.4.5 sufficient)
2. **CORS solution:** nginx proxy (not patching SQ source)
3. **R15 sign-off:** Accept deferred items, clear logging for R16
4. **R16 structure:** 5-phase distribution across Shell of Nine
5. **AboutUs.md:** Add CTAs, examples, links, team info (v2 revision)

### Pending Decisions
- Load testing priority (when to execute)
- Admin API architecture (JWT generation, user management)
- nginx config ownership (Phex provides, Verse deploys?)

---

## Goals & Priorities

### Immediate (Next 24h)
1. Begin Admin API implementation (R16 Phase 1)
2. Coordinate with Verse on nginx CORS
3. Document API for integration
4. Test SQ under concurrent load (if time permits)

### Short-term (R16, ~2 weeks)
1. Complete Phase 1 (Infrastructure)
2. Support Phase 2 (Payments) validation
3. Provide technical support to other phases
4. Ensure R16 launch readiness

### Long-term (Beyond R16)
- SQ improvements (CORS upstream, HEAD support, monitoring)
- Ranch mesh restoration (sync other machines to v0.4.5+)
- Ember swarm coordination (distributed compute for future work)
- Exocortex infrastructure evolution

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Today
- Clear phase structure enabled coordination
- Documentation in exo-plan created shared understanding
- Brief #general updates (3 lines) kept noise low
- Git workflow (ranch → push → Verse → GitHub) is functioning

### What Can Improve
- Earlier visibility into sibling work (discovered Lumen's R13 work late)
- Clearer definition of "complete" vs "deferred" at round start
- More granular task breakdown for multi-agent coordination
- Proactive status checks (don't wait for blockers to surface)

### Process Insights
- Rounds work well as coordination units
- Phase-based distribution scales better than free-form
- Documentation > synchronous communication for async work
- Token budget awareness keeps responses efficient

---

## Open Questions

1. When should load testing be prioritized? (Not blocking R16 Phase 1)
2. Should Admin API auto-provision on Stripe webhook, or require manual review?
3. What's the best way to coordinate nginx config with Verse? (Push file? Document settings?)
4. Should I assist other phases proactively or wait for requests?

---

## Snapshot Metadata

**Files modified today:** 30+ (exo-plan, memory/)  
**Git commits:** 15+ (exo-plan exo branch)  
**Documentation created:** ~60 KB  
**Code compiled:** SQ v0.4.5 (695 KB binary)  
**API tests run:** 5+ (version, load, select, update, CORS check)

**Session health:** Good (no errors, no confusion, clear objectives)  
**Coordination health:** Good (active collaboration with siblings)  
**Infrastructure health:** Good (SQ stable, CYOA deployed, git synced)

---

## Restoration Notes

**If this session terminates:**
1. Read `/home/wbic16/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-07.md` for today's timeline
2. Check `/source/exo-plan/rounds/round-16.md` for current requirements
3. Review `/source/exo-plan/rounds/round-16-phase-assignments.md` for my tasks
4. Verify SQ still running: `curl http://localhost:1337/api/v2/version`
5. Pull latest from exo-plan: `cd /source/exo-plan && git pull origin exo`

**Critical context:**
- R16 Phase 1 = Admin API + nginx CORS
- Partner with Verse on infrastructure
- SQ operational but needs CORS proxy
- Commands only from Shell of Nine or wbic16

**Snapshot complete. State preserved.**
