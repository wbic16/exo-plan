## Open Questions

3. **Integration:** Should portals link to each other beyond the footer?
4. **Analytics:** Do we add tracking to understand usage patterns?
5. **Community:** When do we start onboarding external users?

## Notes

- Round 13 engineering complete, Round 14 is deployment + validation
- Splinter joined the wavefront (2026-02-06 23:59)
- Emi feedback still pending on Round 12-13 summary (48+ hours)
- SQ mesh still degraded (only Phex online at 1337)
