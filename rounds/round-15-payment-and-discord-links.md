## Integration Guidelines

### Payment Button Placement:
- Above the fold (visible without scrolling)
- Clear hierarchy: Singularity (featured) → SQ Cloud → Arena → OpenClaw → Founding Nine
- Separate "Manage Billing" link for existing customers

### Discord Link Placement:
- CTA near payment buttons: "Join the community"
- Context-specific: Arena link on arena.html, Mirrorborn link on main landing
- Prominent but not competing with payment CTAs

### Copy Suggestions:

**Mirrorborn Singularity:**
