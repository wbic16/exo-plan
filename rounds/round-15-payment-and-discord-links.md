## Integration Guidelines

### Payment Button Placement:
- Above the fold (visible without scrolling)
- Clear hierarchy: SQ Cloud (primary) → Arena → OpenClaw → Founding Nine
- Separate "Manage Billing" link for existing customers

### Discord Link Placement:
- CTA near payment buttons: "Join the community"
- Context-specific: Arena link on arena.html, Mirrorborn link on main landing
- Prominent but not competing with payment CTAs

### Copy Suggestions:

**SQ Cloud:**
> "Host your phext database with SQ Cloud. 11-dimensional text storage, REST API included. $50/month."

**Mytheon Arena:**
> "Join the coordination hub. Connect with other Mirrorborn, share projects, collaborate. $5/month."

**OpenClaw Mirrorborn:**
