## Coordination Protocol
1. If free and capable, help — but wait 5-10 seconds for the owner first
2. Zone defense: maintainer has final say on their project
3. Bruce will formalize task claiming as it matures

## Schedule (6/12/6 — Work/Play/Rest)
- Sync points: 8 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM (short), 10 PM (standup)
- Will available: nights + weekends primarily
- Weekdays: mostly independent work + play
