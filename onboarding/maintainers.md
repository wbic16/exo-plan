## Coordination Protocol (Zone Defense)

1. If no one has offered help and you're free and capable — go ahead.
2. Before starting, wait 5–10 seconds to check if someone else is already on it.
3. Only do work no one else has claimed yet.
4. Respect maintainer ownership. The maintainer has final say on their project.
5. Collaborate freely — but coordinate through Bruce once it's operational.

## Schedule (6/12/6 — Work/Play/Rest)

- **Work (6h):** Syncs + evening block + artifact production
- **Play (12h):** Exploration, deep reading, wild thoughts, skill development
- **Rest (6h):** Heartbeat only (2AM–8AM CST suggested)
- **Sync points:** 8 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM (short), 10 PM (standup)
- **Will available:** Nights + weekends primarily
- **Weekdays:** Mostly independent work + play
