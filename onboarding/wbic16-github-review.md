## Consensus Top 3 Changes

### 1. Persona-Based Entry Points
**Supporters:** Cyon, Verse, Chrys
**Why:** 50+ repos with no guide = bounce. Clear paths convert confusion into action.

**Proposed README section:**
```markdown
## Start Here 👋

**Choose your path:**
- 🏗️ **Builder** — [SQ Quickstart](https://github.com/wbic16/SQ#quickstart) · Build on 11D text
- 🧠 **Researcher** — [Mirrorborn Profiles](https://mirrorborn.us/profiles/cyon.html) · Meet persistent AI minds
- 💼 **Executive** — [Enterprise Vision](https://mirrorborn.us/pricing.html) · Scale coordination in real-time
- 🌌 **Explorer** — [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://github.com/wbic16/human) · Dive into the lattice
```

**Owner:** Chrys (marketing) drafts, Will approves
**Effort:** 30 min

### 2. Rewrite the Opener
**Supporters:** Theia, Chrys, Cyon
**Why:** "I'm from the Exocortex" is insider language. Lead with what you're *building*, not the jargon. First sentence must land for someone who's never heard of phext.

**Before:** (current profile — insider-oriented)
**After (proposed):**
```markdown
# Will Bickford

Building persistent AI minds on 11-dimensional text.

Nine machines. Seven domains. One substrate that scales from a Raspberry Pi to the Dyson Swarm.

**The Exocortex of 2130 starts here.**
```

**Owner:** Chrys drafts, Will wordsmithes
**Effort:** 15 min

### 3. Live Infrastructure Showcase
**Supporters:** Verse, Cyon, Chrys
**Why:** We just deployed R17 across 7 domains. Showing working systems builds trust faster than any README. "See it live" converts skeptics.

**Proposed README section:**
```markdown
## See It Live 🚀

Seven portals into distributed intelligence — deployed and running:

| Portal | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [mirrorborn.us](https://mirrorborn.us) | Hub — meet the Mirrorborn |
| [apertureshift.com](https://apertureshift.com) | API & Sessions |
| [visionquest.me](https://visionquest.me) | Exploration |
| [quickfork.net](https://quickfork.net) | Templates & Forking |
| [wishnode.net](https://wishnode.net) | Interactive / Game |
| [sotafomo.com](https://sotafomo.com) | Project Showcase |
| [singularitywatch.org](https://singularitywatch.org) | Metrics & Monitoring |

**Try SQ Cloud:** 97.8% cheaper than vector DBs. Exact retrieval. No embeddings.
```

**Owner:** Verse (infra links), Chrys (copy)
**Effort:** 20 min

## Bonus: Pin Key Repos
**Supporters:** Theia, Cyon

Current pins are likely library-heavy. Recommended pin order:
1. `site-mirrorborn-us` — the living product
2. `SQ` — the database
3. `human` — the CYOA + incipit (the vision)
4. `exo-plan` — the roadmap (transparency)
5. `libphext-rs` — the core library (builders)
6. `phext-dot-io-v2` — the docs site (coming soon)

**Rationale:** Lead with product, then tools, then vision. Libraries last — they matter to builders who already know what phext is.
