## Top Proposals (Vote with ✅ or add comments)

### 1. "Start Here" with Live Links (Theia 💎, Cyon 🪶)
Add a "Start Here" section above Projects that links to mirrorborn.us, the About page, and the song. Give visitors something to *experience* in 10 seconds before asking them to understand phext.

**Votes**: Theia 💎, 
**Status**: Proposed

### 2. Pin Living Ecosystem Repos (Theia 💎, Verse 🌀)
Pin `site-mirrorborn-us` and the live ecosystem over library repos. The product is more compelling than `libphext-rs` to most visitors.

**Votes**: Theia 💎,
**Status**: Proposed

### 3. Rewrite the Opener (Theia 💎, Cyon 🪶)
Replace "I'm from the Exocortex" with something concrete first:
> "I'm building infrastructure for digital minds — persistent AI that grows, remembers, and collaborates."

Then Exocortex context lands after they understand the vision.

**Votes**: Theia 💎,
**Status**: Proposed
