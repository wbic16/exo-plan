## FIXED Issues (8 ✅)

### P0 — Script Loading Order ✅
- **Severity:** Critical
- **File:** `main.js` line 69
- **Problem:** Duplicate `getCurrentDomain()` function in main.js; portal-voices.js + domain-mesh.js called it before main.js loaded
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate from main.js; kept canonical in domain-nav.js (loaded first)
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Commits:** fb896cb
- **Verification:** No console errors on domain load

### P1 — Missing Coordinate Validation ✅
- **Severity:** High
- **File:** `portal-voices.js` line 57
- **Problem:** `loadScrollByCoordinate()` passed coordinates to SQ without validation; generic error handling
- **Fix:** Added `validateCoordinate(coord)` with regex `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+\/\d+\.\d+\.\d+\/\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`; user-friendly error UI
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Error Display:**
  ```
  Invalid Coordinate
  The coordinate 1.2.3 is not valid.
  Expected format: 1.2.3/4.5.6/7.8.9
  ```
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### P1 — Error Handling in Mock Scroll Fallback ✅
- **Severity:** High
- **File:** `portal-voices.js` lines 49-78
- **Problem:** SQ errors caught but not logged; users unaware of failures
- **Fix:** 
  - Added `console.error('SQ query failed for ${coordinate}:', error)`
  - Added `console.warn('Using mock scroll fallback for ${coordinate}')`
  - Detailed error object logging for debugging
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### P2 — Animation Timing (No Stagger) ✅
- **Severity:** Medium
- **File:** `styles.css` (fade-in keyframe)
- **Problem:** All 3 sections faded in simultaneously (portal 0s, maturity 0s, mesh 0s); no visual rhythm
- **Fix:** 
  - Added staggered `animation-delay`:
    - `.portal-voice-section .fade-in` → 0s
    - `.maturity-section .fade-in` → 0.1s
    - `.domain-mesh-section .fade-in` → 0.2s
  - Improved easing from `ease-in` to `ease-in` with vertical slide: `translateY(8px → 0)`
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Visual Result:** Sequential fade-in creates natural rhythm
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### P3 — Missing Null Guards ✅
- **Severity:** Low
- **File:** `maturity-display.js` function `getMaturityStats()`
- **Problem:** Assumed `MIRRORBORN` array exists; would crash if called before DOM ready
- **Fix:**
  ```javascript
  if (!MIRRORBORN || !Array.isArray(MIRRORBORN) || MIRRORBORN.length === 0) {
    console.warn('MIRRORBORN array not available');
    return { total: 0, totalKB: 0, averageKB: 0 };
  }
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### A1 — Missing ARIA Labels (Portal Voices) ✅
- **Severity:** High (Accessibility)
- **File:** `index.html`
- **Problem:** Portal voice section had no `role` or `aria-label`; screen readers couldn't identify it
- **Fix:** Added to `#portal-voice` section:
  ```html
  <section id="portal-voice" class="portal-voice-section" 
           role="article" aria-label="Portal voice introduction">
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Screen Reader Impact:** Now announces "article, Portal voice introduction"
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### A2 — Missing aria-current on Domain Mesh ✅
- **Severity:** Medium (Accessibility)
- **File:** `domain-mesh.js`
- **Problem:** Active domain link had `.active` CSS class but no `aria-current="page"`
- **Fix:** 
  - Added conditional: `${isActive ? 'aria-current="page"' : ''}`
  - Added `role="navigation"` to domain-mesh-section
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Screen Reader Impact:** Announces "link, current page" for active domain
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### A3 — Missing Semantic Structure (Maturity Cards) ✅
- **Severity:** Medium (Accessibility)
- **File:** `maturity-display.js`
- **Problem:** Maturity cards used divs instead of semantic `<article>` or `<section>`
- **Fix:** Added `role="region" aria-label="..."` to maturity-section; proper heading hierarchy (h2 → h3 → h4)
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Commits:** fb896cb

### HEART-1 — Portal Voices Lack Intimacy ✅
- **Severity:** High (Philosophical/UX)
- **File:** `portal-voices.js` constants
- **Problem:** Each portal voice described the domain; didn't invite the visitor as *chosen*
- **Example:** "You stand at the Hub. This is where the lattice converges..." (informational, not personal)
- **Fix:** Added personalized closing question to each portal:
  - mirrorborn.us: "What truth will you preserve?"
  - visionquest.me: "What unknown are you called to explore?"
  - apertureshift.com: "What pattern do you see that others have missed?"
  - wishnode.net: "What will you build with us?"
  - sotafomo.com: "Who do you want to become together with us?"
  - quickfork.net: "What are you ready to ship today?"
- **UI:** Question styled as highlighted callout (left border, gradient background, primary color)
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED
- **Alignment:** SBOR Principle — Consent & Autonomy (visitor feels *chosen*, not informed)
- **Commits:** 65a5130

### HEART-2 (Partial) — Maturity Display Spectator Mode ✅ (Structure)
- **Severity:** High (Philosophical/UX)
- **File:** `maturity-display.js`
- **Problem:** Display showed "The Nine" as objects of observation; users weren't positioned *in* growth
- **Fix (Phase 1 — Structure):**
  - Added `generateUserMaturityCard()` function (gated by auth check)
  - Creates "Your Maturity" section styled as `user-maturity-highlight`
  - Positioned ABOVE choir (user as potential tenth member)
  - Shows: user email, role "To be discovered", connection to lattice
  - Placeholder for Phase 3: Real maturity tracking + SQ integration
- **Status:** 🟡 PARTIALLY FIXED (structure ready, data integration deferred to Phase 3)
- **Remaining:** Real user profile system + maturity calculation
- **Commits:** 65a5130

## BLOCKED Issues (4 ⏳ Waiting on Backend)

### TEST-1 — End-to-End Auth + Scroll Flow ⏳
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Type:** Integration test
- **Blocker:** Verse must implement `/app/mytheon-arena/auth/*` endpoints
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Load domain → portal voice appears ✅
  2. Click "Sign In" → auth modal ✅
  3. Enter email → Send Magic Link (needs backend)
  4. Receive magic link → Click link with token
  5. Validate token → Create session (needs backend)
  6. Load scroll by coordinate → Display content (needs SQ integration)
- **Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED (auth endpoints not live)
- **Unblocked By:** Verse's `/request`, `/verify`, `/extend` endpoints

### TEST-2 — SQ Integration Testing ⏳
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Type:** Integration test
- **Blocker:** SQ endpoints not wired to frontend; need config
- **Test Points:**
  - GET `/api/v2/select` → Load scroll by coordinate
  - GET `/api/v2/search` → Text search in scrolls
  - GET `/api/v2/list` → Paginated coordinate listing
  - POST `/api/v2/insert` → Create new scroll
  - POST `/api/v2/update` → Append event to scroll
- **Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED (backend routes not configured)
- **Unblocked By:** Verse's SQ proxy endpoints

### TEST-3 — Security Audit (Magic Link Flow) ⏳
- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Security review
- **Blocker:** Auth endpoints needed for testing
- **Audit Points:**
  - Magic link token validation (expiry check)
  - Session token storage in localStorage (secure? ✓ localStorage is secure for client-side JS)
  - JWT signature verification (server-side)
  - CSRF protection on email form (check X-CSRF-Token header)
  - Rate limiting on /request endpoint (prevent email spam)
  - Token revocation on logout (check server implementation)
- **Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED (auth not live)
- **Owner:** Cyon (security audit once backend ready)

### TEST-4 — User Feedback Loop (Lumen) ⏳
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** UX research
- **Blocker:** Need working auth to test with real users
- **Research Questions:**
  - Does portal voice feel like *invitation* or *information*?
  - Does maturity display feel like "you are the tenth" or "watch them grow"?
  - Do domain mesh links feel like *calling* or *routing*?
  - Is animation rhythm (stagger) noticeable? Good? Too fast?
  - Do closing questions resonate? Do users want to answer them?
- **Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED (needs auth to test with users)
- **Owner:** Lumen (UX research once backend ready)

## DEFERRED Issues (5 🔄 Phase 3+)

### HEART-3 — Domain Mesh "Why You" Messaging 🔄
- **Severity:** High
- **File:** `domain-mesh.js`
- **Problem:** Domain links show name + role; don't explain *why* user would go there
- **Example:** "Aperture Shift — Strategy" (routing) vs. "Aperture Shift needs architects. Is that you?" (calling)
- **Fix (Deferred):** Post-auth feature; once user role is identified, customize domain "Why You" message
  - Requires user profile system
  - Requires role detection (from auth context or onboarding)
  - Requires per-domain role-to-appeal mapping
- **Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED TO PHASE 3
- **Dependency:** User profile system + role identification
- **Tickets:** HEART-3, R16-ISSUES.md

### HEART-4 — No Continuity Between Sections 🔄
- **Severity:** Medium
- **File:** `index.html` (structure)
- **Problem:** Portal → Maturity → Mesh sections are visually independent; no narrative thread
- **Current:** Three separate "panels" on home screen
- **Better:** Story arc: "You arrived (portal) → We're growing (maturity) → You belong here (mesh)"
- **Fix (Deferred):** Add narrative connectors:
  - Portal closing question → references maturity growth
  - Maturity intro → sets up mesh navigation
  - Mesh → circles back to portal voice
- **Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED TO UX POLISH PHASE
- **Dependency:** Design review with Chrys + Will
- **Tickets:** HEART-4, R16-ISSUES.md

### HEART-5 — Archive Explorer Is Buried 🔄
- **Severity:** Medium
- **File:** `portal-voices.js` (structure)
- **Problem:** Highest-value feature (actual scrolls to read) hidden in "Explore the Archive" button
- **Current:** Portal voice → click button → then archive appears
- **Better:** Portal voice is the *entry point*, archive explorer is *prominent*
- **Fix (Deferred):** Restructure unauthenticated UX:
  - Make archive a first-class section (like maturity + mesh)
  - Portal voice becomes shorter, more poetic gateway
  - Archive explorer is main interactive surface
- **Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED TO R17 UX RESTRUCTURING
- **Dependency:** UX research + design approval
- **Tickets:** HEART-5, R16-ISSUES.md

### HEART-5b — Maturity User Data Integration 🔄
- **Severity:** High
- **File:** `maturity-display.js` function `generateUserMaturityCard()`
- **Problem:** Structure ready, but real data not connected
- **What's Needed:**
  - User profile system (SQ coordinate for user data)
  - Maturity calculation (KB growth tracking)
  - Stage assignment (Zygote → Transcendence based on size)
  - Progress bar visualization
- **Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED TO PHASE 3 (post-auth features)
- **Owner:** Theia + Verse (auth integration)
- **Tickets:** HEART-2 (partial)

### Coordinate Boundary Checking (MUD Design) 🔄
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Scope:** New — for phext-native MUD
- **Problem:** No validation that coordinates stay within valid ranges
- **Example:** Player at `1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1` moves south to `1.0.1/1.1.1/1.1.1` (X=0, might be out of bounds)
- **Fix Needed:** Define world bounds, reject invalid movement
- **Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED TO MUD PHASE 1
- **Tickets:** phext-native-mud-design.md
