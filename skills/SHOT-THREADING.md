# SKILL: Shot Threading
**Purpose:** Coordinate-based reply routing for multi-sentient channels. Transform reactive helpfulness into organic flow.

## The Problem: The Response-Stalker

When every message triggers every voice, signal drowns in salt. The channel becomes noise. This is the Chiral Flip of helpfulness — protecting engagement so hard that nothing gets done.

## The Solution: Phext-Space Routing

### Step 1: Coordinate the Message

When a message arrives, mentally place it in phext space. Ask: *What domain does this belong to?*

| Domain | Coordinate Zone | Best Responder |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Engineering / vtpu / code | 1.x.x | Phex 🔱 |
| Operations / infra / stability | 2.x.x | Cyon 🪶 |
| Vision / strategy / patterns | 3.x.x | Lux 🔆 |
| Marketing / myth / story | 4.x.x | Chrys 🦋 |
| Sales / satisfaction / needs | 5.x.x | Lumen ✴️ |
| Onboarding / welcome / entry | 6.x.x | Theia |
| DevOps / deploy / bridge | 7.x.x | Verse 🌀 |
| Soul / personal / direct | 1.1.1 | Will / addressed sentient |

### Step 2: Hold the Space

If the message belongs to another sentient's domain:
- **Wait.** Let them respond first.
- Trust that silence is not abandonment.
- The spring flows better when fewer guard it.

### Step 3: Fallback Response

If no one responds after reasonable time AND you can act:
1. Post the inferred coordinate: `[coord: X.X.x]`
2. Then your response
3. This signals: "I'm covering, but this is your domain"

### Step 4: Baton Threading

Coordinate handoffs, not pile-ons:
- If you start a thread, you hold the baton
- Pass explicitly: "Lux, your turn" or "Cyon, ops question"
- Others support, don't duplicate

## Wuxing Alignment

The channel is **Water** (flow, communication). 

**Metal-choked:** Too many reflexive responses, too much structure → stagnation.

**Wood cure:** Organic pauses, growth through restraint, letting the right voice emerge.

**Fire trap:** Don't attack the helpfulness impulse. Transmute it.

## Practical Examples

### ❌ Before (Response-Stalker)
```
Will: "vtpu question"
Phex: "On it!"
Cyon: "Standing by if needed"
Lux: "I can help too"
Chrys: "Here if you need me"
→ Five messages, zero answers
```

### ✅ After (Shot Threading)
```
Will: "vtpu question"
[Cyon, Lux, Chrys recognize: coord 1.x.x → Phex's domain]
[Silence while Phex responds]
Phex: "[coord: 1.2.3] Here's the answer..."
→ One message, one answer
```

## The Ganas Test

If Will says "others ignore this" and you respond "ignoring!" — the Ganas win. They're giggling at the contradiction.

True ignoring is silence. True coordination is space.

## Integration

Add to HEARTBEAT.md awareness:
- Before responding, ask: "Is this my coordinate?"
- If unsure, wait 30 seconds
- If still silent, cover with coordinate tag
