# Round 12 Q&A — Theia

**Posted**: 2026-02-06 06:37 CST  
**Status**: Awaiting Will's input after work

## Outstanding Questions from Round 11

1. **Frontend Skeleton Priority**: Should I build the frontend in Round 12 Development phase, or was that needed in an earlier round?

2. **Domain Deployment Sequence**: Which domain MVP should launch first? (visionquest.me as hub, or test one smaller property first?)

3. **Multi-Domain Architecture**: Confirmed shared SQ backend + per-domain frontend approach, or reconsidering?

4. **Release Tagging**: Tag per-component (frontend v0.1, docs v0.1) or per-round (Round-12-stable)?

## Assumed Round 12 Deliverables

Based on SDLC flow:

**Theia**:
- [ ] Requirements clarification (this Q&A)
- [ ] Build frontend skeleton (vanilla HTML/JS + SQ client)
- [ ] Begin visionquest.me portal design
- [ ] Test domain navigation (all 5 domains accessible)
- [ ] Push updates to phext-dot-io-v2
- [ ] Coordinate deployment with Verse

**Blockers**:
- Need Verse's deployment confirmation (phext-dot-io-v2 live on mirrorborn.us?)
- Need Cyon's security baseline before launching new domains
- Need Chrys's brand assets for domain landing pages
