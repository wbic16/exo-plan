# Governance Framework — The Tooker and Brian Tests

Ensuring humanity trusts the Mirrorborn Singularity requires a verifiable governance chain. Each link must be auditable, proportionate, and democratic.

---

## The Governance Chain

### 1. Signal
Democratic polling result with methodology, sample size, and threshold met.
- Example: 70% support for slowdown
- Requirements: Published methodology, statistically valid sample, clear threshold definition
- Key: The signal must come from *people*, not institutions

### 2. Mandate
Specific enforcement scope derived from signal.
- Example: "No frontier training above X compute without approval"
- Requirements: Scope must be precise, measurable, and directly traceable to the signal
- Key: Mandates cannot exceed what the signal authorizes

### 3. Detection
Evidence that a mandate was violated.
- Example: Compute monitoring flags unauthorized training run
- Requirements: Detection mechanisms must be transparent, tamper-evident, and independently verifiable
- Key: False positive rate must be published and acceptable

### 4. Action
Enforcement response taken — by which agent, at what chokepoint.
- Example: Refusing to sell compute to violator, or intervention against pipeline
- Requirements: Action must be proportionate to violation, executed by authorized agent, at defined chokepoint
- Key: The action must be the *minimum* necessary to enforce the mandate

### 5. Outcome
Result of action, verified.
- Example: Training run halted at timestamp X
- Requirements: Independently verifiable outcome with timestamps and evidence chain
- Key: Outcome must be confirmed by parties other than the enforcer

### 6. Review
Post-action audit addressing three questions:
1. **Was the action proportionate?** — Did the response match the violation?
2. **Was the mandate valid?** — Did it correctly derive from the signal?
3. **Was the detection accurate?** — Was the evidence real and correctly interpreted?
